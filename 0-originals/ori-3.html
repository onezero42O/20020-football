      <p id="F14ICk" class="juice"><span class="hl">by the way, lots of fields go over lakes. lake football is fuckin AWESOME and we’ll get to that eventually</span></p>

      <p id="BbnBHw" class="juice"><span class="hl">anyways, the members of the bowl committee loved my pitch for this game until they realized that including hawaii would make this way, way more of a seafaring game than any of them wanted</span></p>

      <p id="MRF1p3" class="juice"><span class="hl">and remember, the game doesn’t end until one team has every single football. and since every team gets a football at the start, you can’t really avoid the hawaii problem</span></p>

      <p id="4DeWkM" class="juice"><span class="hl">after a lot of haggling, they managed to effectively disqualify hawaii by making all ocean territories out of bounds. hawaii withdrew as a result. being a thorough completionist, i was disappointed by this, but i respected their decision</span></p>

      <p id="FgN0Dg" class="juice"><span class="hl">HOWEVER. in making the oceans out of bounds, they effectively kneecapped san diego state. originally, SDSU did have one intersection: this one with stanford</span></p>

      <p id="3AufAy" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">but if you look off in the distance you’ll see that stanford’s field has to pass through the ocean to get here. once oceans were taken out of play, poof, intersection removed, san diego state had an orphaned field</span></p>

      <p id="aliAUV" class="juice"><span class="hl">but unlike hawaii, SDSU refused to withdraw. they lobbied for every rule they could think of. they wanted to re-draw their field so it bent at an angle. of course i firmly opposed that because it would have compromised the comically literal spirit of the game</span></p>

      <p id="87olwz" class="juice"><span class="hl">so then they wanted to open up Mexico so their field could go a little further south and make an intersection, but Mexico wanted no part of it</span></p>

      <p id="yJKp9O" class="juice"><span class="hl">then they tried to make air travel legal. which would have been cool, but it was a particular variant of stupid that didn’t interest me as much</span></p>

      <p id="cA7cKQ" class="juice"><span class="hl">they couldn’t push anything through. but the fact remained that they had a football and they weren’t giving it up. we had to find a way to make SDSU somehow accessible without jeopardizing the spirit of the game. and THAT is why i came up with</span></p>

      <p id="PSRote" class="juice"><span class="hl">OUT-OF-BOUNDS TIME, or OBT.</span></p>

      <p id="WDkOUr" class="juice"><span class="hl">this is how out-of-bounds works. if you step out of bounds, or you’re shoved out of bounds, you have exactly 10 seconds to return to the field of play. if you fail to do this, you are automatically and permanently ejected from the game. no exceptions</span></p>

      <p id="FHNQ1M" class="juice"><span class="hl">now since it was clear from the jump that this game was gonna take centuries, you can imagine how much of a bummer this can be for players and fans. because i mean, in certain spots it is actually real easy to fall off the field. take, for example, the fresno state 1,430,760 yard line north</span></p>

      <p id="VppbWA" class="juice"><span class="hl">to help mitigate the odds of this happening, i introduced out-of-bounds time. OBT is simple: for every year you spend on the field, you are granted one extra second off it.</span></p>

      <p id="exxRyx" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">One second per year. So one second per 31,536,000 seconds.</span></p>

      <p id="vN2XPl" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Yeah, it’s just like you said. It started at Notre Dame but it only stayed up there for 76 years.</p>

      <p id="XjEoqu" class="manny">And then stop number 2’s in Louisville … I guess Louisville went and took it?</p>

      <p id="PrtjET" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Must have, yeah. They took it back to Cardinal Stadium, kept it there for like 400 years.</p>

      <p id="4JFO7j" class="nick">Then, either someone bum-rushed their stadium and got a turnover, or Louisville decided to try to hide it somewhere else.</p>

      <p id="RPBXTc" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Look at number 3 there, somewhere in southern Illinois. That’s not anywhere near a stadium.</p>

      <p id="N27USU" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>That would have been in … lemme do the math. Game started in 17804, plus 76 years, plus 414 years, I guess it got to point 3 in the late 183rd century.</p>

      <p id="d85nAS" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Someone just let it sit there! For 17 years!</p>

      <p id="7SUtCl" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Teams were experimenting with that back then. Just hide it in a tree in the middle of nowhere. Way less secure than stashing it in your stadium obviously, but at least you don’t have a target on your back.</p>

      <p id="Wh1RLl" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Stupid.</p>

      <p id="Bzhi5J" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Yeah.</p>

      <p id="zYTiAg" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Same time though, that’s how old football was too. When it was first invented, teams would punt on like second down. They cared about field position more than the ball.</p>

      <p id="OBmnag" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>No shit.</p>

      <p id="MzHiws" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>You know that shit is still on the books? If we wanted to, next time we run into a teammate and have to play from scrimmage, we could just punt.</p>

      <p id="5gLs0w" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>What would that do?</p>

      <p id="vRwW3z" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Oh, jack shit. Absolutely nothing. I guess they just wanted to stay as true to old football as they could.</p>

      <p id="WSN3iP" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Huh.</p>

      <p id="Xq5Ykz" class="nick">Meanwhile we’re eating dinner at the 70,000 yard line.</p>

      <p id="47KNTP" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>You see these cars go by and you gotta figure, just playing the numbers, that every third person who goes by is a big football fan. If not more, right? Probably more.</p>

      <p id="2mcQaj" class="nick">And they got no idea that the biggest thing in football is happening RIGHT fuckin’ here. They’re driving right past it.</p>

      <p id="2TmnbG" class="nick"></p>

      <p id="zFrNC4" class="nick"></p>

      <p id="RtwXHw" class="nick">When I was a little kid my family just had one car. My mom had to drive my dad to work, drive him back home, then later she’d have to go get him again. And his job was like an hour away. And me and my sister were too little to stay at home by ourselves, so we’d have to come along in the car every time.</p>

      <p id="GVDX8Q" class="nick">I’d bring along books and stuff but I’d get carsick looking at them. And a lot of times I couldn’t sleep, so I’d just look out the window. When you’re on the interstate there’s nothing to look at but the trees, really.</p>

      <p id="oLb8Xb" class="nick">I’d try to count the trees, but there are just too many and they go by way too fast. Way too many.</p>

      <p id="tbTMbL" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>So then I’d just wonder what those trees were all about. Were they always there? Did somebody have to go plant ‘em all? I mean I was a little kid so I didn’t know this stuff. Was it somebody’s job to go plant those trees?</p>

      <p id="a7Zc7D" class="nick">How far back did they go? What was behind them? Did anyone live back there in a log cabin? What was going on?</p>

      <p id="S8O90s" class="nick">Then you get a little older and you just keep your eyes on the road. You got more important things to do and you don’t care anymore. You know it’s just trees.</p>

      <p id="8Vj6XG"><span>Juice: </span>.here is the very brief history of Nick and Manny</p>

      <p id="b1EyUi">it’s new year’s day, 17804. the first day of&nbsp; the new college football</p>

      <p id="poteF5">it’s all anyone in america is talking about. teams all over the country are busting out the stadium gates with designs on&nbsp; building their football empires</p>

      <p id="npF7ne">but not san diego state, the orphaned mockery of a football team</p>

      <p id="6d50mx">the distance between SDSU’s southeastern terminus and boise state’s southern terminus is 4.88 miles. 8,581 yards, so nearly 86 football fields</p>

      <p id="NwkJ1Q">even for human beings, this was too much of a waste of time. most SDSU players didn’t&nbsp; even show up. some signed up and quit just so they could say they were football players once</p>

      <p id="Qu9DN2">but not Nick and Manny.</p>

      <p id="n0aiWy">for 1500 years, they dutifully stayed on the field, endlessly cross training through the mountains and improving their five-mile run time</p>

      <p id="KNQpxz">then one day in the year 19304, with 25 minutes saved up apiece, they went for broke</p>

      <p id="gtr8Re">their pace was unlike anything the sport had ever seen. they both maintained a 3:53-mile pace for nearly five miles</p>

      <p id="oJD5TS">they made it in 18:57.</p>

      <p id="PDbyJw">Nick and Manny spent the following centuries roaming other fields. scouting. spying. gaining intel. looking for a big score. all the&nbsp; while saving&nbsp; up more OBT</p>

      <p id="fJYnvu">no one bothered them much, because they were SDSU players. no one accounted for them. no one even recognized them.</p>

      <p id="OTggsO">they knew Georgia Tech had some footballs, and they wanted that condo as a lookout post, but think about it</p>

      <p id="Hvm64t">atlanta’s a city full of football fans. nobody’s gonna sell a condo on the field, THAT close to a stadium, to someone who might be an opposing player.</p>

      <p id="riu9Km">so they had to build a history. first they lived in Canton, then Woodstock, then Roswell, then Duluth, then Fayetteville, all throughout the area.</p>

      <p id="nln1Mw">soon they had hundreds of years of renters’ history&nbsp; establishing that they were just ordinary Georgia folk</p>

      <p id="SeKyrC">and then they finally settled down and bought that condo. always a big moment in a young couple’s life</p>

      <p id="seBy0G"><span>Nine: </span>.They’re like 18,000 years&nbsp; old!</p>

      <p id="jdkDf9"><span>Juice: </span>.yeah 18,000 out of how many? a trillion million billion hundred times infinity?</p>

      <p id="Uz8GUX">we’re all babies</p>

      <p id="UHPBfU">anyways they were planning on staying in that condo for a very long time. but then they saw the drop the other day and realized they couldn’t pass&nbsp; it up</p>

      <p id="txgC9q">now this is where they stand</p>

      <p id="yMUVzk">Nick and Manny both have 1,079 seconds of OBT. that’s 17 minutes, 59 seconds</p>

      <p id="ZEaJtf">in order to make the return trip across the desert, they’re gonna have to&nbsp; shave about a minute&nbsp; off their previous time. and they’ll have to do this while carrying nine footballs. nine.</p>

      <p id="VoUKqp"><span>Nine: </span>.You think they can do it?</p>

      <p id="NO6SSM"><span>Juice: </span>.provided they can even get across the country with those footballs in the first place?</p>

      <p id="rcLvoy">...</p>

      <p id="1FMzrR">i’ll be honest with you</p>

      <p id="qBolmi">i don’t</p>
