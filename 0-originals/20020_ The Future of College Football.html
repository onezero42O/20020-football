      <p id="NILjj1" class="radio"><span class="name">Radio: </span>In these certain times, the people of Georgia don’t need much of anything from their public servants. My name is Joshua Alexander, and I’m running for state governor.</p>

      <p id="U4Y292" class="radio">You know, I grew up on a farm outside of Dalton. And maybe it’s just my simple country upbringing, but I don’t believe much in politics. I don’t have a political platform of any kind. I have no agenda.</p>

      <p id="oXEdMJ" class="radio">Leave it to a country boy like me to lay it out straight, I suppose: I want to be governor just to be governor. I can’t even explain to you where this impulse comes from. I possess the personal and political convictions of a boulder tumbling down the mountain. That is how I will govern.</p>

      <p id="rhLwz6" class="radio">I would be honored to have your vote in November. I’m Joshua Alexander, and I approve this message.</p>

      <p id="Q9Su2e" class="radio"><em><strong>You’re listening to NEW-NEW-NEWWWWSTALK 680. Atlanta’s most trusted news source.</strong></em></p>

      <p id="z2RJtu" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>For this guy? Alexander or whoever?</p>

      <p id="R1NWgh" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Oh, I don’t know. I just want the sticker they give you.</p>

      <p id="QO5NwV" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>You can just buy the stickers online.</p>

      <p id="BMbNsU" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Oh well fuck it, I’ll just do that.</p>

      <p id="9tcBv1" class="radio"><span class="name">Radio: </span>You might think it’s a little funny that we’re on the same ad together. The Yellow Jackets and Panthers have found ourselves in quite a few dogfights over the years.</p>

      <p id="SaWZYr" class="interviewee"><span class="name">Interviewee: </span>But you know, Connor, sometimes it’s important that we all work together.</p>

      <p id="p6eDIA" class="radio"><span class="name">Radio: </span>That’s right, Suzy. Here in Georgia, Tech and State rely on our fans to stay vigilant. It’s no secret that football in this state is bigger than ever. Tech has several footballs ...</p>

      <p id="yLlY2E" class="interviewee"><span class="name">Interviewee: </span>… and so does Georgia State. And if we’re gonna bring even more footballs home to Georgia, we’re gonna need to protect the footballs we’ve already got.</p>

      <p id="CZxoPL" class="radio"><span class="name">Radio: </span>As a matter of policy, we hide our football in locations we keep confidential, and teams throughout the country are pulling out all the stops to find them.</p>

      <p id="eEBU1Y" class="interviewee"><span class="name">Interviewee: </span>And as a fan, that’s where you come in. If you see a player on the field you don’t recognize, call our tip line at (404) TECH-STATE-FANS.</p>

      <p id="jIotjH" class="radio"><span class="name">Radio: </span>Together, we can keep football alive and well in the state of Georgia. Help us protect the rock.</p>

      <p id="9BNLkp" class="radio"><span class="name">Radio: </span>NewsTalk 680 Atlanta, I’m Kay LaValliere. Coming up on 1 a.m. local time. At Hartsfield Airport, 77 degrees and clear skies.</p>

      <p id="UpyWpL" class="radio">A man is recovering at his Decatur home after being bored Tuesday. Police say Richard Diaz was waiting for his pickup order at an area Cracker Barrel when the battery on his phone died. Diaz spoke about the incident to NewsTalk 680.</p>

      <p id="5okiXG" class="interviewee"><span class="name">Interviewee: </span>I got to the Cracker Barrel a little early and they said it’d be a few minutes, so I played a game I got on my phone where you’re a waitress lady and you have to serve a bunch of pancakes before your customers get mad and leave. It’s kind of sarcastic when you think about it. Or ironic or whatever the word is for it.</p>

      <p id="Rhb5Pj" class="interviewee">So I was playing that but then my phone died, and then I remembered that I left my charger in my wife’s car so I couldn’t charge it. So I went in and asked them if my food was ready yet and they were waiting on a new batch of fries to come out of the fryer, but that they’d be extra hot and crispy when they were done. So I said, that’s all well and good but could I borrow a phone charger? But they said they didn’t have the right kind of charger for my phone.</p>

      <p id="YuUg1r" class="interviewee">So then I said, well, could I sit at one of y’alls’ tables and play one of the games y’all have on the tables? And they said the dining are was for dine-in customers only. So I said, well, can y’all bring one outside so I can just play it in my truck for a few minutes?</p>

      <p id="WB8dpI" class="interviewee">So they did, but they gave me the triangle peg game where you gotta make the pegs jump over each other and I’d already played that one a million times. I was hoping they’d give me the Towers of Hanoi game or one of them other games, but the peg game was all they had.</p>

      <p id="wWD9Jz" class="interviewee">So I started to play it anyways. </p>

      <p id="kE0EuD" class="interviewee"><span class="name">Interviewee: </span>But pretty soon I just realized that I wasn’t even really trying to beat the game, I was just moving the pegs around in different holes. I wasn’t even following the rules really. That’s when I started to feel bored.</p>

      <p id="KGfRyo" class="radio"><span class="name">Radio: </span>Diaz says that’s when he alerted restaurant employees, who dialed 911.</p>

      <p id="WEAeyD" class="interviewee"><span class="name">Interviewee: </span>The police came pretty fast. One of them gave me a book about ants that was pretty cool. How they all work together to build their hills and stuff. Before I knew it, my fries were done so I went in and picked up my fries, and then I went home and my wife and me ate the fries that I got at the Cracker Barrel. They were really good. Some other places try to do all kinds of fancy things to their fries but Cracker Barrel just makes regular fries the way they ought to be made and my wife and me like ‘em a lot.</p>

      <p id="G4GCQ2" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Yeah, ‘cause remember? Last time I went to the Sandy Springs one, they remodeled their produce department. Most of the veggies aren’t on the field anymore.</p>

      <p id="89U51h" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Well you know how the field cuts through the parking lot and then the front entrance, and then kinda goes diagonal through the left side of the store right? So they still have the little stands outside by the front doors with like tomatoes and everything, but once you go in, the produce isn’t on the left anymore. They moved it so it’s more in the middle, so you can’t reach most of it.</p>

      <p id="NqkYSn" class="juice"><span class="hl">and i mean they can use one of those tennis courts you see there, but only the one on the left. that makes for some weird situations. sometimes they’ll go down there to play, and people will be playing on that one but the rest are free. so of course people are like, why do you wanna play on this one? why don’t you take one of the other ones.</span></p>

      <p id="wANHbv" class="juice"><span class="hl">now you and i and they know that they can’t use those other courts because they’re not on the field. but Nick and Manny are undercover. can’t let anyone know.</span></p>

      <p id="mJRlCj" class="juice"><span class="hl">i think honestly since they’ve got such a solid foundation to their relationship they actually have the time and energy left over to argue about the little things. and i mean remember, nick and manny have been sharing this apartment for 30 years and it is BY NO MEANS a big condo. to call it a two bedroom is generous. it’s really just one bedroom and a glorified little office room. i bet your husbands quirks stand out a lot more. the little things that irritate you get all that much more annoying after a while</span></p>

      <p id="lnUiRh" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">up north. to tennessee i bet</span></p>

      <p id="YHXJHD" class="juice"><span class="hl">there’s an offense moving around up there with a ball and only a couple dozen players. tech already has about 20 defenders up there, they’re just sending these folks for reinforcements</span></p>

      <p id="8rApp0" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">So this is how you get a football. You go find an offense that’s advancing and line up against them.</span></p>

      <p id="2KPVhz" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yeah it works the same way as conventional football. four downs, ten yards for a first down, all that. Tech’s defense can get the ball if they force a turnover on downs, or a fumble, or an interception</span></p>

      <p id="tYQWIq" class="juice"><span class="hl">this is way too aggressive though. they’ll be leaving the barn door open here, because now they have nobody defending their stash</span></p>

      <p id="CbRsES" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">And Nick and Manny are allowed to go down there and take the balls?</span></p>

      <p id="S2CJU5" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yep. they’re loose footballs</span></p>

      <p id="23fxVy" class="juice"><span class="hl">so listen, this is what they’re doing here. every team has 125 players, right? according to the old college football rules, you get 125 players</span></p>

      <p id="QPVCVi" class="juice"><span class="hl">you don’t really have any way to know for sure where your opponent’s players are but you can make good guesses based on what you’ve seen, what your teammates have seen, what other people have seen, news stories, whatever</span></p>

      <p id="95Lcjj" class="juice"><span class="hl">but if they can account for the location of all 125 players they can deduce there is fuckin NOBODY home</span></p>

      <p id="iSi6Rn" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>We know Tech has at least 20 players up in Tennessee, right around the 200,000 yard line.</p>

      <p id="gjgdOC" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">eh they’re actually in north georgia but close enough</span></p>

      <p id="QAr4eD" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Then all across Kentucky they have 50, minimum. Coach said they have one confirmed group of 30 players near Lexington, and then another team of at least 20 in Danville.</p>

      <p id="kSu0Cm" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">more or less accurate, they got 25 near lexington and 25 more in danville</span></p>

      <p id="yE57QA" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>So that gets us to 70 players accounted for, minimum. Probably closer to 80.</p>

      <p id="ERKqOa" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>That gets us to 125 easy.</p>

      <p id="9FwZCz" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">well from strictly a gameplay perspective this isn’t the craziest thing that ever happened, but it is pretty major. Nick and Manny don’t even know how major it is yet. they think they’re about to get one football</span></p>

      <p id="JTfvNs" class="juice"><span class="hl">they have no idea they’re about to get nine balls. that would be the biggest turnover in years</span></p>

      <p id="FHt46V" class="juice"><span class="hl">and typically when there’s a huge turnover like that, it’s because some legion of like 50 players bum-rushed an opponent</span></p>

      <p id="yp6zyK" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Yeah, yeah. Sleeping bags should be in there already. Water, trail mix, phones, charging blocks … your phone charged?</p>

      <p id="sEoTZy" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>No, it’s at like 40 percent.</p>

      <p id="BbGL4z" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>You gotta plug it in when you’re not using it!</p>

      <p id="F0vVko" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>It’s fine, it’s fine, it’ll be good in like an hour. We should leave in like …</p>

      <p id="6ui3IV" class="manny">… it’s 1:30 now. We should be out of the house by three. 3:30 latest. Can you make us some coffee?</p>

      <p id="QijdD8" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Yeah hold on, hold on, let’s just sit and go over the play real quick.</p>

      <p id="rFAIED" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">anyways</span></p>

      <p id="lo7OLl" class="juice"><span class="hl">for just two players to recover nine footballs is real crazy. so </span><span class="hl"><em>at the moment</em></span><span class="hl">, if they just get these balls in the first place, i’d rate it at like a 7. you should calibrate your excitement to 7 out of 10</span></p>

      <p id="uUspGi" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">I’ll put it at 4 because I don’t trust your judgment.</span></p>

      <p id="HrzhcF" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">i’ll take a 4</span></p>

      <p id="zPbTX0" class="juice"><span class="hl">HOWEVER. getting the footballs is only the first step. there’s a long ass way to go. but if Nick and Manny can actually pull this whole thing off i’d put it at like a 9.5</span></p>

      <p id="vlRRNJ" class="juice"><span class="hl">basically an unprecedented event. if they can get nine footballs all the way home it’s gonna fuck up the entire nature of the game. the balance of power would change throughout college football</span></p>

      <p id="PGphU3" class="juice"><span class="hl">thats a big IF though. bein frank with you i don’t think they can do it</span></p>

      <p id="JFFqz7" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Can we stop now? Are we at a stopping point?</span></p>

      <p id="6Yx168" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Okay listen. Coach drew up some stuff for us but none of them accounted for Tech leaving an empty net. We don’t have to transfer to the Georgia State field … I think we stay on the Tech field.</p>

      <p id="6QDbFi" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">oh wow i’m becoming bored very quickly</span></p>

      <p id="xkB3T8" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Yeah because look, they’re all heading north. We can just scoop the ball and sneak behind them for a while, stay quiet. They’re not gonna know.</p>

      <p id="S3mgzR" class="nick">And you know what, I bet they’re goin’ all the way up to Tennessee, even Kentucky maybe. That’ll give us a lot of places to transfer as long as they don’t turn around.</p>

      <p id="rmDnjn">here’s georgia tech’s field. it’s 53 yards wide, as usual</p>

      <p id="DwaU82">but it’s a little bit longer</p>

      <p id="j7CcYz">it goes over the wall, into the stands, through the concourse, and out into georgia tech’s campus. all this is part of the field as well</p>

      <p id="9hP5z7">eventually it makes its way to atlanta’s centennial park</p>

      <p id="jzwBB3"></p>

      <p id="JQd96D">where it runs into the other field!</p>

      <p id="f9Xb6e"></p>

      <p id="TPwPy3">and this field belongs to ...</p>

      <p id="AwJfOC"></p>

      <p id="Ce0VXK">georgia state.</p>

      <p id="a8fucg"></p>

      <p id="JSy2ce">at the start of this&nbsp; game, both of these teams have a football. the object of the game is to take the other team’s football.</p>

      <p id="OmeFSd"></p>

      <p id="6rSDmv">these two schools do not like each other, and holy hell do they go at it</p>

      <p id="2BDeGC"></p>

      <p id="zoYghV">so what does it look like when both teams have a ball?</p>

      <p id="g1p62d"></p>

      <p id="4aEhmH">well, maybe this player hangs back to defend</p>

      <p id="fAAOLU"></p>

      <p id="zvqse2">or maybe she runs a post route past the trees so her QB can bomb it</p>

      <p id="lNP7yy"></p>

      <p id="tQ09Dh">strategically it’s very interesting</p>

      <p id="1zYuYM"></p>

      <p id="E5pduN">alternately, georgia tech might prefer to play it safe and stay home</p>

      <p id="3mzxpi"></p>

      <p id="krK09a">or get aggressive and drive the ball through a damn office building</p>

      <p id="Qf9t25"></p>

      <p id="A4BeQY">there are lots of options, because this field is very long</p>

      <p id="dHvRKi"></p>

      <p id="kkoZnG">VERY&nbsp; long.</p>

      <p id="70THEv"></p>

      <p id="6ZEfsw">it goes through buildings, rivers, forests, farms, you name it</p>

      <p id="tIuioN"></p>

      <p id="j5AdWA">oooooof a quarry. huge pain in the ass here</p>

      <p id="pvRTj5"></p>

      <p id="AWgwrp">well hell. i wasn’t the one who built the stadium at that angle. go take it up with bobby dodd</p>

      <p id="J0bQSG"></p>

      <p id="dMJZsY">anyways. this field won’t stop until it hits the ocean</p>

      <p id="rLnUaD"></p>

      <p id="h3xiXL">but you know what i&nbsp; realized this game needed?</p>

      <p id="odKR1H"></p>

      <p id="rDvqTI">a third team with a third field</p>

      <p id="B0oxz8"></p>

      <p id="OnpSv1">here lemme get the lights</p>

      <p id="65Jl0j"></p>

      <p id="ew6NP2">see, now we got a triangle. you can loop. a defense might be ahead of you ...</p>

      <p id="01U4E9"></p>

      <p id="W6fDCC">or it might be behind you. so that can be pretty interesting as well</p>

      <p id="xPuuqA"></p>

      <p id="O9lggG">now, THIS team comes from way up north</p>

      <p id="V1u8QB"></p>

      <p id="gMJcPr">see, the reason purdue’s field can intersect is that their stadium isn’t perfectly north-south</p>

      <p id="hxGu8H"></p>

      <p id="s2avGD">why’d they build it that way in 1900 and whenever?</p>

      <p id="E5jzmj"></p>

      <p id="vhDaMV">who cares. we got us a ballgame</p>

      <p id="7e8Iwd"></p>

      <p id="MFMe1C">these three fields are a combined 6,139,649 yards. that’s about 3500 miles</p>

      <p id="WJikro"></p>

      <p id="Fm0RWp"></p>

      <p id="XiTy15"><span>Ten: </span>.I will say that I can’t quite&nbsp; figure it out thematically. I get Georgia Tech vs. Georgia State, but what does Purdue have to do with anything?</p>

      <p id="nhhd7i"><span>Ten: </span>. How many teams are in this game?</p>

      <p id="WZvS9w">Spit it out. Just spit it out.</p>

      <p id="suhRkZ"></p>

      <p id="Qw3pPN"><span>Juice: </span>.hm? oh no it does not work AT ALL</p>

      <p id="dHKujR"></p>

      <p id="9M2ZgL">it’s an absolute disaster of a football game</p>

      <p id="QLlLPx"></p>

      <p id="X8TO4K">it’s horrible</p>

      <p id="0qRQRD">in the 1990s, lunchables were a popular option for schoolchildren seeking agency in their lunchtime meal. while cafeteria food typically came as it came, lunchables offered virtually endless permutations of food. with lunchables pizza, this frontier was explored further via</p>
