        <p id="E5A8ZF" class="rulebook">
          By default, teams operate under “free play” rules. Most players (see
          below) are free to wander throughout any field they choose. A team
          need not move as an entire unit. For example, a team may opt to divide
          into several different units, or even send 125 players to 125 separate
          locations.
        </p>

        <p id="Qtf37r" class="rulebook"><strong>6b – Scrimmage play</strong></p>

        <p id="7w5z3M" class="rulebook">
          Scrimmage play operates under conventional football rules, i.e. four
          downs allowed, and ten yards for a first down. However, both teams can
          line up as many or as few players as it chooses. For example, it is
          permitted for a 50-player offense to line up against a 50-player
          defense, or for a 20-player offense to line up against a 100-player
          defense.
        </p>

        <p id="qUm7pK" class="rulebook">
          <em
            >A team enters scrimmage play if a team encounters, identifies, and
            issues a verbal challenge to an opposing team in possession of a
            football.</em
          >
          The challenging party must be within 50 yards of their opponent.
        </p>

        <p id="XtsqN5" class="rulebook">
          If a team fails to achieve a first down, the ball is turned over on
          downs, and that team is then on defense.
        </p>

        <p id="soXA8S" class="rulebook">
          The onus is on the offense to break through the defense with a big
          play. If the ball carrier eludes being tackled for a period of 24
          hours, this team returns to “free play” mode, and can roam the field
          with the football until challenged again.
        </p>

        <p id="yDUsG7" class="rulebook">
          At times, two teams who each possess a football may encounter one
          another. In this circumstance, both teams will simultaneously play
          both offense and defense, with all above rules applying.

      <p id="lkRSJQ">.there he goes</p>

      <p id="ZIw8rO">
        <span>Ten: </span>.Whooooa there, interesting way to take this turn
        here, J. You steering an oil tanker?
      </p>

      <p id="2AXkRZ">
        <span>Juice: </span>.whatever fine just&nbsp; take the wheel. you’re
        better at&nbsp; this than me
      </p>

      <p id="HzFpb6">
        now we’re about&nbsp; to drive through the georgia tech field for a sec.
        watch what happens on the scoreboard
      </p>

      <p id="9FRKvg">BLOOP</p>

      <p id="KJRrGL">
        <span>Nine: </span>.Man, he really has no idea he’s got a football in
        the back!
      </p>

      <p id="D3RLb0">
        <span>Ten: </span>.Just so we’re clear, that little blip on the
        scoreboard ... all the teams saw that, right?
      </p>

      <p id="Fg9yWN"><span>Juice: </span>.Georgia Tech did, yeah</p>

      <p id="DfVXs9">
        <span>Ten: </span>.So just based on the timing of it, Tech can probably
        do some back-of-the napkin math and figure out that this guy pulled onto
        the highway.
      </p>

      <p id="uKPPGw">
        But who knows if that information is even helpful. Probably not.
      </p>

      <p id="gns3B5">
        <span>Juice: </span>.now here’s the important thing about the scoreboard
      </p>

      <p id="rQfeFD">
        there’s the full admin version, the version you’re looking at, that
        displays ALL the data
      </p>

      <p id="fddbZ8">
        only game officials get&nbsp; to look at it. the teams and players will
        never see this
      </p>

      <p id="4m77mS">
        for example, georgia tech gets to look at&nbsp; this instead
      </p>

      <p id="k46dfL">
        <span>Nine: </span>.So you see the teams ranked by how many footballs
        your opponents have, but you don’t actually&nbsp; see how many they
        have.
      </p>

      <p id="a4s4uX">
        <span>Juice: </span>.yep. you see who’s winning, but you don’t know by
        how much
      </p>

      <p id="sUklnD">
        <span>Ten: </span>.It looks like we’ll be passing through Georgia
        State’s field shortly. Can we look at their scoreboard?
      </p>

      <p id="6Qdo9Q"><span>Juice: </span>.yeah lemme pull it up</p>

      <p id="Vc9W8H">
        <span>Nine: </span>.This is not a lot of information to work with.
      </p>

      <p id="OZW1w2">
        <span>Ten: </span>.Then again though? At least it lets you know when
        there’s a ball on your field that you wouldn’t otherwise know about.
      </p>

      <p id="OjZnhc"><span>Juice: </span>.oh yeah for sure. news you can use</p>

      <p id="z4F9y3">“news you can use.” huh i like that</p>

      <p id="ptbXC2">you think i’m the first one to ever come up with that</p>

      <p id="rYNCLM">
        <span>Nine: </span>.No. Wilkes-Barre Record. September 18th, 1930.
      </p>

      <p id="HhBt3P">“News you can use.”</p>

      <p id="QyDisa">Now shut up, I wanna see this.</p>

      <p id="xEWfDD"><span>Juice: </span>.lol excuse me! jesus</p>

      <p id="NRtSmT">.BLOOP!</p>

      <p id="sHKR8K">
        <span>Ten: </span>.Well, that must have been fun for Georgia State. They
        jumped to the 8th-ranked team in the nation for ... three seconds or so.
      </p>

      <p id="Sty8qd">
        <span>Juice: </span>.they waited centuries to get there too. they
        haven’t seen that ding on their scoreboard in ages
      </p>

      <p id="e2IMhC">
        <span>Ten: </span>.What is Georgia State supposed to do with&nbsp; that?
      </p>

      <p id="MNPU1T"><span>Juice: </span>.i mean jack shit really</p>

      <p id="ObHqt8">
        they only know the ball was on their field somewhere. but they
        don’t&nbsp; know where. and their field goes from florida to michigan.
        good luck with that
      </p>

      <p id="uXxrGY">
        <span>Ten: </span>.This is such a confusing football game.
      </p>

      <p id="ylSEit"><span>Juice: </span>.why thank you</p>
