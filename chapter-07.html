        <p id="1EEmzL" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>All right, I sent a few files over. You should get ‘em in a minute.</p>

        <p id="BKQuvi" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>Alright.</p>

        <p id="eYX5EJ" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>When’s the last time you were in Tennessee, Mike?</p>

        <p id="2jPyBq" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>Looong time, man. Long time. Probably eight, nine hundred years ago.</p>

        <p id="Q9OPD4" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>You should make a trip here sometime. Trees are beautiful in the fall, especially if you can get up high somewhere.</p>

        <p id="coxcl0" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>You see any of those big neon signs when you crossed the state line?</p>

        <p id="8AWRsC" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Nah, not really. When you cross into Tennessee from the Tech field, you just pass through the woods.</p>

        <p id="0eacB1" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>So I lived in Georgia way back. The big thing everybody did was, you know basically all fireworks are illegal in Georgia, right? Like you can get sparklers, but that’s about it.</p>

        <p id="HpK27N" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Yeah!</p>

        <p id="iIu4fa" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>So everybody would just drive up to Tennessee, where you could buy any kind of fireworks you wanted. It was all legal. As soon as you crossed into Tennessee on I-75 you’d get a sunburn from all the neon signs for fireworks places.</p>

        <p id="2cmkbV" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>So it was like a religious pilgrimage.</p>

        <p id="60pGis" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>Yeah, exactly! I remember one time me and my dude, his name was Nick too actually, we got this thing that was like a superpowered Roman candle. And Nick was a fuckin’ idiot. And we’re on his front porch, which is like screened in, you know, and he decides he’s gonna shoot it off right there and then.</p>

        <p id="RKxBOk" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Oh no.</p>

        <p id="7APQHD" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>And I swear to God. You know when the nanobots detect that something’s about to go REAL bad? It’s not like normal where you can’t really see ‘em. If it’s an emergency you can actually see a cloud of ‘em.</p>

        <p id="vaKD1o" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Yeah, sure.</p>

        <p id="RVgJgU" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>You can almost hear ‘em like “ohhhh shit.” Like they’re mad. And I’m telling you, a cloud shot up off the ground and knocked the lighter out of his hand.</p>

        <p id="jQot2q" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Holy shit.</p>

        <p id="IARePw" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>I swear, those fuckin’ nanos have emotions. Or maybe just one emotion. They just get annoyed with you, having to save people from danger for the rest of time.</p>

        <p id="M2fIT5" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>They should be able to talk.</p>

        <p id="CDs0AG" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>Yeah.</p>

        <p id="D9MDNB" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Like if you’re about to set off a Roman candle indoors, you hear this big booming voice out of nowhere. “DANGER! DANGER! IDIOT IS NEAR!”</p>

      <p id="Yn6lfq" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yup. Grambling’s really the only team that takes SDSU seriously. nick and manny hit them up a while back because unlike a lot of programs, Grambling actually does the shit they say they’re gonna do</span></p>

      <p id="ghZyG3" class="juice"><span class="hl">right now they can offer SDSU assistance with play calling, which they need badly right now. Grambling has some players on the team who’re engineers, mathematicians, whatnot. folks who are real useful when you’re tryin to put together a game plan</span></p>

      <p id="bGrKzn" class="juice"><span class="hl">remember though, SDSU’s a joke. almost all their players are players on paper only</span></p>

      <p id="rJ0qf3" class="juice"><span class="hl">but it’s like, alright</span></p>

      <p id="wBK4b1" class="juice"><span class="hl">being a San Diego State player means that in order to actually play the game, you have to run that five-mile stretch across the desert. if you’re a very well-conditioned athlete, you can make it in 30 minutes. 30 minutes is 1800 seconds. you get one second of OBT per year, so you need to wait around for almost 2000 years</span></p>

      <p id="ifjYYF" class="juice"><span class="hl">but hey, in the meantime, enjoy the city of San Diego! oh what i meant to say is, enjoy this little ass sliver of San Diego. enjoy the one coffee shop you got! enjoy the 34 square feet in the dining area of the thai place you love! it’s a great spot! make friends with the people whose lawns you can legally wander around in! people love it when you do that! enjoy your stay, let’s touch base in 18 goddam centuries</span></p>

        <p id="8ISo3y" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>Yeah, I get you. You’d rather let it chill just off the field for a while. Let Michigan State notice Georgia Tech fall down the scoreboard and send their players down to Tech instead of looking for you.</p>

        <p id="dll5Tr" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Yeah, and once we feel like they’ve took the bait, after a few days, we pick up the balls and run. That buys us some time and space, at least.</p>

      <p id="A9a5Tu" class="nick">I’m trying to park it, like, ten or twenty yards from the field. Any more than that, that’s just more seconds of OBT Manny’s gonna have to spend to run out and get it. We need every second.</p>

      <p id="04v7bl" class="nick">I had a nightmare last night where I started the train, sent it down the track, and missed it by a ton. And he had to spend five minutes running down the track to go after it.</p>

      <p id="AqltLV" class="nick">And they say you can’t do math in dreams, but that’s bullshit, because I knew five minutes was 300 seconds. And 300 seconds is 300 years of OBT. 300 years he spent saving up that time, staying on the field, cooking me dinner, making me laugh. Being there for me every time I was fucked up about something. And like, it was like I could see those years just vanishing from history, just disappearing.</p>

      <p id="FDK6Pc" class="nick">All because I fucked it up. Because I didn’t do the math right, forgot something, guessed wrong.</p>

        <p id="ttJf5S" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>You can’t see it like that. When you and your husband took your vows, I guarantee there was nothing in there about being God.</p>

      <p id="fuVodj" class="mike">It’s never been anyone’s responsibility to do what’s impossible. It’s not yours.</p>

        <p id="JuaBKc" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>You think it’s impossible?</p>

        <p id="2YAobE" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>No. But you don’t have all the numbers, so it won’t be about the math.</p>

      <p id="xgZK3g" class="mike">Here. Tell me about the prettiest throw you’ve ever seen. The time you saw a quarterback drop one in and you were just like, “how the FUCK did they do that?”</p>

        <p id="JMENLB" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Uhh.</p>

      <p id="o7KH9x" class="nick"></p>

      <p id="FrBm1I" class="nick">Well this one isn’t the best throw I’ve ever seen. It definitely wasn’t even an important throw in the big scheme of things. God, I can barely remember what it even looked like, I don’t think I’ve seen it since I saw it on TV.</p>

      <p id="fvFmHP" class="nick">It was a Mike Vick throw. So I guess this would have been the year 2000 or 2050, sometime around then, whenever it was he was in the NFL.</p>

      <p id="UmpyCO" class="nick">It’s basically garbage time, right? He’s on the Eagles at this point. Eagles are down a couple scores, there’s like a minute left, game’s pretty much over.</p>

      <p id="iXGADf" class="nick">It’s fourth and long. Vick does all you can do in that situation, which is just throw for the end zone.</p>

      <p id="FBLhtI" class="nick">He’s got uh, the tight end, Brad Celek I think? Brent Celek? He’s got defenders all over him. But Vick whips it in to him.</p>

      <p id="6xgaMA" class="nick">The thing about the way this ball looked in the air ... it was like an optical illusion. On TV, it looked like it was going at like a thousand miles an hour. No arc to it. Looked like a bullet.</p>

      <p id="NqUmFv" class="nick">But the thing is, when they showed the replay close up, when it landed in Celek’s hands, it dropped! If all you saw was that close-up shot, it looked like it floated into him. Floated perfectly through all the defenders’ limbs, through a window that was like EXACTLY one football wide. Right in there.</p>

      <p id="vk6laF" class="nick">Touchdown didn’t matter, they lost. But it was a touchdown.</p>

        <p id="OiTaE3" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Nah, I bet nobody does. Not even him.</p>

        <p id="OZUlUo" class="mike"><span class="name">Mike: </span>You know what I’d bet anything on, though?</p>

      <p id="ygJuov" class="mike">Even at that moment, if you went up and asked him how he threw it, he wouldn’t be able to tell you.</p>

      <p id="dqPdEL" class="mike">I mean yeah, he’d be able to say, you know, “I made these reads, this was my progression, this was the pressure I was feeling on the right side of the line, this is how much confidence I had in my guy to haul it in.”</p>

      <p id="mLeAxZ" class="mike">But the force he put on the ball? The motion of his arm, the timing of it? Fuck NO he couldn’t tell you how he did that! No one ever can. It’s just something you do.</p>

      <p id="MgEJRd" class="mike">And yeah yeah yeah, with this one, you got a train. You got maps, you got calculations. You’re not working the mechanics he did, you’re just filling a diesel tank and throwing a few switches.</p>

      <p id="6psF37" class="mike">But it’s still a throw.</p>

      <p id="SSqOJ7" class="mike">You just gotta feel it.</p>

      <p id="VIJTej" class="juice"><span class="hl">as for nick, that’s all about where the locomotive’s parked. it’s never the exact same place. i bet he loses 30 seconds runnin up to the cab to start it up</span></p>

      <p id="EP6Ugv" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">I’ll be the optimist, then. I say Nick fires a direct hit and the train stops right on top of the Spartans’ field. Neither loses a second.</span></p>

      <p id="M2UEAB">it appears he’s leaving … only about five&nbsp; and a half gallons of diesel!</p>

      <p id="2YHz5Z">very unusual call here. i don’t think he’s gonna get enough zip on the ball. what do you make of it, partner</p>

      <p id="V5uG5u"><span>Nine: </span>.I have to agree. This train’s got three cars on it. You figure you’re only gonna get around one mile per gallon. He needs more than double this much to make it 13 miles.</p>

      <p id="Nl57F7">He could be hanging his receiver out to dry here.</p>

      <p id="74jke0"><span>Juice: </span>.well, apparently he’s satisfied. before he leaves for the cab, he sets the footballs right there&nbsp; on the outside of the chassis</p>

      <p id="KJeHnr"><span>Nine: </span>.Smart move here. If you look, you see the balls are still within Georgia Tech’s field. He doesn’t&nbsp; want to&nbsp; set off their alarm bells until the very last possible minute.</p>

      <p id="lNLjrG"><span>Juice: </span>.running to the cab now is Navarro. the clock on his OBT is officially rolling</p>

      <p id="7UuXKb">Nine, this is the first time he’s stepped off the field in centuries</p>

      <p id="WnzUEZ"><span>Nine: </span>.He’s got to get this engine started as quickly as possible. Every second that rolls off the clock, J, that’s a second that it’ll take an entire year to earn back.</p>

      <p id="xXlSiI"><span>Juice: </span>.10 seconds off the clock now. we’ll be following the train as it rolls west, strap in with us</p>

      <p id="vzGcEn">20 seconds</p>

      <p id="A6fDby"><span>Nine: </span>.This is too much time.</p>

      <p id="0IDyYO"><span>Juice: </span>.30 seconds</p>

      <p id="kfT8us"><span>Nine: </span>.This is getting into dangerous territory. If he kills much more time, he’s not gonna even have a shot at the desert run in California.</p>

      <p id="cATs7g"><span>Juice: </span>.45 seconds gone now for Navarro</p>

      <p id="ZKXTNY"><span>Nine: </span>.This play is turning into a disaster for San Diego&nbsp; State. Way too much time in the pocket. He’s gotta get rid of the ball.</p>

      <p id="XqgYDn">What is he doing?</p>

      <p id="ia37xy">I don’t know if there’s engine trouble or what. What a&nbsp; scene here in Tennessee.</p>

      <p id="6z2ShW">At this point, Navarro is effectively taking himself out of the running to make it home to San Diego.</p>

      <p id="SJvIob"><span>Juice: </span>.AND HERE</p>

      <p id="j9F53j">WE&nbsp;</p>

      <p id="uoHuNO">GO</p>

      <p id="bRgVpK">Navarro jumps off the train and lets it ghost-ride</p>

      <p id="pQKRxA">he’s now back on the field, and his OBT&nbsp; clock stops at ... 16 minutes, 43 seconds. CRUCIAL amount of&nbsp; time burned off the clock there</p>

      <p id="RYLaIa"><span>Nine: </span>.Tell you what, this train is moving faster&nbsp; than I&nbsp; thought it would.</p>

      <p id="s5MvIv">We’re gonna see if we can give you a picture of something here. Ten, can we get a&nbsp; camera on the Tech field, right on the track?</p>

      <p id="EQK0Or"><span>Juice: </span>.he uncoupled it</p>

      <p id="1nEZ52"><span>Nine: </span>.He uncoupled the freight cars!</p>

      <p id="DK64dI"><span>Juice: </span>.Navarro clearly taking the extra&nbsp; time off-field so he could uncouple the locomotive. it must have given him some trouble, but what a move</p>

      <p id="jNbZXW"><span>Nine: </span>.And all of a sudden, five and a half gallons of fuel sounds just about right.</p>

      <p id="dH0AYr">Meanwhile, it looks like Georgia Tech’s taken notice, and ... wow. All&nbsp; the squads are immediately being called back. All the teams in Michigan, too.</p>

      <p id="x6OcD7"><span>Juice: </span>.back in tennessee, the train makes some turns as we enter the home stretch</p>

      <p id="NS5k8L">and partner, it’s slowing down at just the right&nbsp; time</p>

      <p id="VTM6fh">wow, what an approach</p>

      <p id="pnYaIM">and the train’s coming to a stop ...</p>

      <p id="e5kFDZ">that’s only fifty yards from the field!&nbsp;</p>

      <p id="rqDs01">INCREDIBLE touch on this throw</p>

      <p id="45yz82"><span>Nine: </span>.Unbelievable. His receiver’s only gonna need to burn a few seconds of OBT&nbsp; to go get it.</p>

      <p id="8WWwup"><span>Juice: </span>.and now all that’s left to do is wait for&nbsp; the programs across the country to notice the scoreboard</p>

      <p id="iFQg4k"><span>Nine: </span>.There’s Ohio State. They just saw the scoreboard, clearly, and they’re wasting no time.</p>

      <p id="FXycNP">There’s Georgia, sending ...&nbsp;</p>

      <p id="Z3BgpA">a little more than sixty.</p>

      <p id="O1ILfs">Look at Oklahoma State! They’re sending&nbsp; the house&nbsp; after&nbsp; them.</p>

      <p id="9FmrBO">Purdue ...</p>

      <p id="KLPmWY">South Carolina sending 100 players ...</p>

      <p id="msCffU"></p>

      <p id="gaaf3s"></p>

      <p id="iRPtgy">They’re&nbsp; all coming.</p>

      <p id="Y0h227"></p>

      <p id="KLWuAX"><span>Juice: </span>.they’re taking the bait</p>

      <p id="URgrDL">it worked.</p>

      <p id="qDyJSt">JESUS CHRIST IT&nbsp; WORKED</p>

      <p id="2mT2CN">HOLY FUCK</p>

      <p id="Hwvr9D"><span>Nine: </span>.Squads from all over are converging on the Georgia Tech field.</p>

      <p id="vmerJJ">The whole country’s lighting up.</p>

      <p id="K7hSvS"><span>Juice: </span>.and friends</p>

      <p id="K7efB2">it ain’t there</p>

      <p id="bCIcLp">it’s right under everybody’s noses&nbsp; and they got no fuckin idea</p>

      <p id="aezOvJ">friends, this is instantly one of the greatest throws in college football history:</p>

      <p id="vlNTsp"><span>Nine: </span>.The Locomotive Lateral.</p>

      <p id="viLG48"><span>Juice: </span>.the Locomotive La</p>

      <p id="73zOkf">awwwwww YOU’RE SHITTIN ME</p>

      <p id="U9yInm">I HAD THAT IN MY POCKET&nbsp; FOR 20 YEARS</p>

      <p id="yIZlKa"><span>Nine: </span>.Sorry.</p>

      <p id="7f0TCz"><span>Juice: </span>.FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK</p>
