        <p id="ATN2KW" class="bryce"><span class="name">Bryce: </span>Ion’know</p>

        <p id="X9g1x2" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>Let’s do the counter. Let’s be the counter crew.</p>

        <p id="6659IS" class="bryce"><span class="name">Bryce: </span>Okay</p>

        <p id="hwuzCt" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>Got a new recruit, Gunner?</p>

        <p id="XHXt1r" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>Yep, we got Bryce here, he’s gonna be our new QB2!</p>

        <p id="sLcR1H" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>Well, congratulations to our newest Trojan! I knew it was a special occasion. Y’all haven’t been down here in too long. Bryce, you oughta be honored!</p>

        <p id="aMyy28" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>Oh, it’s a big day, Linda. Big day for our new guy here.</p>

        <p id="ovc3yB" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>Well, I sure hope you enjoy. The menus are right there in the rack with the salt and pepper. Y’all take your time and let me know when you’re ready to order.</p>

        <p id="ULSwUz" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>Tell you what, Bryce, I’m not gonna lie to you. Part of the reason I’ve been lookin’ forward to this is sitting at a counter and getting a hot plate of food.</p>

      <p id="cecqDX" class="gunner">I could’ve put my order in a month ago, Linda. I could’ve stuffed it in an envelope and mailed it to you. Three eggs, sunny side up, double order of hash browns and a side of sausage. Tell you what, the only eggs I’ve had all this year are scrambled eggs that come out all rubbery. It’s hard cooking on a propane stove.</p>

        <p id="jyx8Nw" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>Oh, you’ve got one of those little ones, right?</p>

        <p id="w8XDZU" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>Yeah, just one of them tiny little jobs, and a little steel mess kit. And if you don’t wash it right after you eat it’s Hell to get the eggs scraped off ‘em. Half of me wants to quit and ask you for a job! Least I’d get a nice flat top to cook on!</p>

        <p id="EaAodw" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>You’re a football hero, Gunner! Who else is gonna run the Troy defense?</p>

        <p id="5yy8Ey" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>You’re damn right! You’re damn right.</p>

        <p id="Lg9uPz" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>Hon, you still lookin’?</p>

      <p id="qMib6I" class="bryce">Burger</p>

        <p id="xXTpBX" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>You got it!</p>

      <p id="ODAASs" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">I remember this guy.</span></p>

      <p id="YCUUac" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yeah?</span></p>

      <p id="rFKQWX" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Yeah, Bryce. He’d wander into this game or that from time to time, never stuck around.</span></p>

      <p id="nW6KPK" class="ten"><span class="hl">I remember he used to irritate me. He was gifted eternal paradise and not only did he not take advantage of it, it didn’t even occur to him that he was delivered a miracle. I get that self-improvement is only so important now, but Jesus, you’d think that after a few thousand years, you’d at least give it a try.</span></p>

      <p id="nzy1YG" class="ten"><span class="hl">Instead he’d just lean on the side of his Acura hatchback in some parking lot, always wearing these cargo shorts and a gigantic white T-shirt, mumbling into his flip phone, always having some argument with a friend over some $20 weed deal. The only thing he’d ever talk about was how he was going to install undercarriage lights in his hatchback.</span></p>

      <p id="BT6MLB" class="ten"><span class="hl">I checked in on him two hundred years later and he was still doing the exact same thing. In more or less the exact same place.</span></p>

      <p id="yzXtjd" class="ten"><span class="hl">He never got those lights put in. Even in a post-scarcity world! A world where you can just go to an ATM and there’s five hundred bucks already waiting in the tray for you! You can go do this whenever you want! And he never did, he just stood around and talked about it!</span></p>

      <p id="gpFnIN" class="ten"><span class="hl">Then I got older and I came to realize how perfectly fine that is.</span></p>

      <p id="596OFP" class="ten"><span class="hl">I can tell you every single thing about the Hyades star cluster. Anything and everything you want to know. Bryce probably thinks the Sun is a hundred miles from Earth. I couldn’t tell you which of us is happier.</span></p>

      <p id="D68GDU" class="ten"><span class="hl">You know? Spend it however you want. You’ll never run out.</span></p>

      <p id="gc5voL" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">this guy is cool</span></p>

      <p id="KwGo19" class="juice"><span class="hl">this guy is me</span></p>

      <p id="69UL9g" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">It’s why I love you.</span></p>

      <p id="z0DINe" class="ten"><span class="hl">Took me a minute, though.</span></p>

      <p id="ez4LbU" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">oh i know</span></p>

        <p id="Hla2mp" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>I mean, I won’t lie to you, son. I’ll tell you the same thing I tell every recruit. Our field at Troy is not a fun field. Have a look at it here.</p>

      <p id="Zkp9JB" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">lol their field is dog shit. just a matter of bad luck really</span></p>

      <p id="iaMXQ7" class="juice"><span class="hl">there’s this stretch of about a million yards where it runs into absolutely nothing. like in corydon, indiana there’s a gumball machine. that’s like it though</span></p>

        <p id="PSr7bz" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>In terms of amenities, we’ve got pretty rotten luck. You can see we’re in Ponce all the way down south, and believe or not, this is the only place you can get a hot meal in a restaurant between here and Indianapolis. Even goin’ through Troy, the field manages to make a clean miss of every restaurant in town. Same with all the other little towns here.</p>

      <p id="fwWyQt" class="gunner">Then north of Indy, it’s pretty slim pickin’s as well. I should let you know in Muskegon, there is an Arby’s, but the field only runs along the front door and the corner with the condiments and whatnot. Used to be, they were nice enough to come around the counter and bring your order out to you, but they got tired of being hassled so they put up a sign saying “counter service only.’ Sometimes if you’re extra hungry, and extra tired of camp food, you can squeeze yourself out some horsey sauce.</p>

      <p id="libj7C" class="gunner">That’s about it, though. Between Indianapolis and Canada, that’s it. No grocery stores, no department stores, nothin’.</p>

        <p id="UEV8f0" class="bryce"><span class="name">Bryce: </span>Man I’ll just go to another field.</p>

        <p id="tE7ohg" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>Well.</p>

      <p id="lfjC42" class="gunner">Y’see … and you know, not everybody is always happy about this, but this is the way we do it at Troy. For the first hundred years, you play defense.</p>

      <p id="oIaYpl" class="gunner">And you know what that means. When you’re on the 25-player defensive squad, you can’t leave the field, it’s against the rules. But this way it’s actually good, I think. By the time your hundred years are up and you transfer to the offensive unit, you’ll know every single branch of every single tree on this field!</p>

        <p id="58U87t" class="bryce"><span class="name">Bryce: </span>Pshhhhh</p>

      <p id="mPPVkG" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yeah kid fuck this</span></p>

      <p id="LLAble" class="juice"><span class="hl">get the fuck outta here, this shit sucks</span></p>

        <p id="FUdDQv" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>Well</p>

      <p id="vcmfz6" class="gunner"></p>

      <p id="gyMX0J" class="gunner">Well you know, you’ll really be a superstar in this program once you do. The Troy football program, you know, we really value those who know our field inside and out. Other programs think they can safely hide a ball on our field? No sir! No sir, they can’t. We’ll sniff it right out.</p>

        <p id="mWJdsd" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>I’m sorry y’all, I’m still trying to get it up on the TV. The cable man gave us a new clicker and I’m trying to figure how to make it work with the old box. I guess if it’s … ope!</p>

        <p id="66NJR1" class="marty"><span class="name">Marty: </span>–bzzZzrt–where. They are. And how. In the world. Georgia Tech allowed this to happen.</p>

        <p id="MDtIbQ" class="linda"><span class="name">Linda: </span>There you boys go. Guess it’s uh, they have one of them talk shows on.</p>

        <p id="nCLRxF" class="gunner"><span class="name">Gunner: </span>Appreciate you, Linda.</p>

        <p id="6SWFDt" class="marty"><span class="name">Marty: </span>And this is what we know, Clark. On the night of October 12th, that was just one week ago today, Georgia Tech, who had remained one of the top five teams in the nation for more than four hundred years, did not just fall out of the Top 5. They did not just fall out of the Top 25. They fell all the way to the bottom, Clark.</p>

        <p id="naW34u" class="clark"><span class="name">Clark: </span>And you know what, Marty? I’m sitting next to you today with egg on my face. I believed in Georgia Tech. When it first happened, the line coming out of Bobby Dodd Stadium was, “look, we’re relocating our footballs. We’ve moved them off the sideline to somewhere more secure.” And I believed them.</p>

      <p id="2Cl5UM" class="clark">And now to find that they’re all, in fact, on the WKU field, incontrovertibly points to the fact that this was a cover-up. They lied to their fans. They lied to America. They have no clue, just like the rest of us!</p>

      <p id="Upq0NT" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">ohhhh shit theyre on the WKU field now huh</span></p>

      <p id="KjkGvH" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Yeah, I’ll track ‘em down. One sec.</span></p>

        <p id="zuQ3Pq" class="marty"><span class="name">Marty: </span>And what’s SHOCKING about this moment? What’s most shocking of all?</p>

      <p id="D8G71O" class="marty">Is that dynasties fall piece by piece, Clark. They don’t collapse all at once like this. This doesn’t happen!</p>

        <p id="9U8KpI" class="clark"><span class="name">Clark: </span>You are absolutely right, Marty. Something like this belongs in the ancient era of this game. We’re talking the 17900s, the 18200s. Wayyyy early on in this game. Before the strategies and schools of thought were really clearly developed. Before superpowers learned how to be smart about how they carried their footballs and where they hid them.</p>

      <p id="T55ZrA" class="clark">This was a failure of leadership. There is no reason that a team in the 20000s should be keeping every football in one place. No matter how secure it is. No matter who’s guarding it. And I think the only way forward is for Connor O’Malley to step down as the leader of the Georgia Tech football program.</p>

        <p id="LUOrHp" class="marty"><span class="name">Marty: </span>I couldn’t agree more, and you know what, I will go further than that. I think they need to overhaul the entire program. If I’m the athletic director at Georgia Tech, I cut every player on my team. I pull people in from off the street. I rebuild and spend the next five hundred years training them up into a team that can win. Because you know what, the sun has set on this era. It’s over. No one in Atlanta wants to hear it, but it’s over.</p>

        <p id="z4NoxN" class="clark"><span class="name">Clark: </span>And now, of course, the important questions for the rest of the country, is who has those footballs, and where are they? Speaking of that, I believe Stacy has a forecast for us. Stacy?</p>

        <p id="u0MIDo" class="stacy"><span class="name">Stacy: </span>Yes, Clark and Marty, thank you. We were expecting to see one of the biggest logjams we’ve seen in college football in decades, and we are certainly seeing that right now.</p>

      <p id="wPHcpA" class="stacy">If we could get the scoreboard on screen, yes, thank you. If you look at the scoreboard, you can see the movement we saw in the rankings yesterday.</p>

        <p id="PloOrp" class="stacy"><span class="name">Stacy: </span>You can see here as WKU absolutely vaults up the scoreboard, from nearly the very bottom all the way up to sole possession of the #3 ranking. Naturally, we can conclude here that however many footballs Georgia Tech lost, most if not all of them were taken to the WKU field.</p>

      <p id="LuTJTw" class="stacy">Guys, within this stretch of field we already have nearly 800 players, and many, many more are on the way. I wouldn’t be surprised to see half the players in college football on or near the Western Kentucky field in a few days’ time.</p>

        <p id="oI2eF5" class="clark"><span class="name">Clark: </span>Stacy, what kind of search area are we looking at?</p>

        <p id="JTLN1h" class="stacy"><span class="name">Stacy: </span>Well, Clark, it’s reasonable to believe they’re within a stretch of field of around 10 miles. Teams have been closing in on them from both sides, and in such number that it would be impossible to hide.</p>

      <p id="WzWFF5" class="gunner">See in these lakes, and in the Mississippi Sea to the west, there’s a lot of fields. It’s legal to cross those fields in the water, provided you’re not using motor power. You could use a rowboat or a kayak or a canoe or something. Or if you really want a workout, I suppose you could swim.</p>

      <p id="SawQ2j" class="gunner">Teams used to use those fields a lot. Lots of important throughways there. Real important strategically.</p>

      <p id="OkmIMW" class="gunner">Then about five hundred years ago, the Sharks showed up.</p>

      <p id="Mt4fXr"><span>Nine: </span>.From a certain perspective, these lakes make a lot of sense.</p>

      <p id="RXarQY">An immortal person is not a perfect person, and an eternal life is&nbsp; not a perfect life.</p>

      <p id="OvVLEy">I’m living forever, right? All three of us are?</p>

      <p id="g5h85M"><span>Ten: </span>.We’ve scanned our trajectories for the next 500 billion years, and yep, smooth sailing.</p>

      <p id="hO1Uc3"><span>Nine: </span>.Same for everybody down there?</p>

      <p id="co4sY0"><span>Ten: </span>.Yep.</p>

      <p id="cjtVv8">For those who lost their homes to the encroaching water, it was a traumatic experience, but they&nbsp; all made it.</p>

      <p id="qMFUre"><span>Nine: </span>.I wonder if they ever see it like I do.</p>

      <p id="W8bVkU">I look at myself&nbsp; and I see imperfections. Half the time I don’t know what’s going on. Apparently I’m going to wake up for a few weeks&nbsp; at a time,&nbsp; cruise for a couple of millennia, and do it again.</p>

      <p id="12NNZ9">My batteries suck.&nbsp; My data storage is core rope memory. Wires&nbsp; that&nbsp; were literally sewn into the board in patterns of ones and zeroes.</p>

      <p id="A6hsPo">These imperfections will persist until the end of time, and there’s nothing&nbsp; I can do about that. My life will never be a perfect one.</p>

      <p id="pbvpGI">Those lakes, and the ruins that stick out&nbsp; of them, remind me that it’s not&nbsp; supposed to be. This is not Heaven. Waters rise and batteries fail.</p>

      <p id="PBhXpG">This is a universe in which things can still fuck up. And that’s where&nbsp; I belong.</p>

      <p id="Prqq9Q">I BELONG here. I can’t tell you how good that&nbsp; feels.</p>

      <p id="eQVwoN"><span>Ten: </span>.You know</p>

      <p id="BbNmDx">You could argue that this, functionally speaking, is a Heaven of sorts. Perfection is the end of the road. Why the Hell would you want to be at the end of the road?</p>

      <p id="fbQrFL"><span>Nine: </span>.I wouldn’t. I like it here.</p>

      <p id="8jjLZA">So tell me about the Sharks.</p>

      <p id="yLTnJk"><span>Juice: </span>.oh man</p>

      <p id="mqrWRJ">absolute menace</p>

      <p id="dYBCc2">struck terror into every team&nbsp; in the nation for centuries</p>

      <p id="QbMtKo">horrifying ability to strike without warning</p>

      <p id="sdGCRp">stolen so many footballs that teams advance all the way up to missouri just to avoid the region</p>

      <p id="WTTNZk">singlehandedly influences the geographic footprint of college football</p>

      <p id="IWNRKy">inspiration for countless ghost stories</p>

      <p id="m3W1Mj">fuckin amazing, basically</p>

      <p id="uhUPzZ"><span>Nine: </span>.Who do they play for?</p>

      <p id="ssjOWi"><span>Juice: </span>.i mean shit</p>

      <p id="N56lFq">you wanna talk to “the Sharks”? i can arrange a call</p>

      <p id="ai2SRR"><span>Nine: </span>.God yes, I’d love that.</p>

      <p id="eliYje">I have to learn more about these people.</p>

      <p id="kJcjMe"><span>Juice: </span>.ha</p>

      <p id="nZTDU9"></p>
