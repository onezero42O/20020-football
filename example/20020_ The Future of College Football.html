      <p id="Bb35Tl" class="radio"><strong>It has been a WILD night here in Stillwater for those of us staring at the scoreboard. Oklahoma State has fallen all the way down from #3 in the country, all the way out of the rankings. While that might seem at first like disaster, it sure seems as though whoever’s carrying these footballs is running scared from Oklahoma State football.</strong></p>

      <p id="bTTLZa" class="radio"><strong>Coach E, once again, thank you for being gracious enough to come on the program in the middle of the night.</strong></p>

        <p id="B3TqI0" class="coache"><span class="name">Coach E: </span>Happy to, Greg, I’m happy to.</p>

And of course, there are some operations you do not want to make public. But how much can you tell us about what Oklahoma State is doing to recover these footballs?</strong></p>

        <p id="Jyr91Q" class="coache"><span class="name">Coach E: </span>Now, you are right that at the moment, there are things we will say about this situation, and things we won’t. But one thing I can tell you, Greg, is that we’re sending the whole house after them. All 100 players are giving chase, and we’ve got our 25 home-field players ready to support as well.</p>

        <p id="h0ZBko" class="radio"><span class="name">Radio: </span><strong>But at any rate, Coach, recovering a fumble of this size could change the future of Oklahoma State football. We’ve seen how a high ranking has helped recruiting for other programs. Hell, we’ve seen how it’s benefited Michigan State, that’s for sure.</strong></p>

      <p id="waiI9T" class="radio"><strong>So what I would love to hear from you is, you know, you’re a newcomer to this program. You’ve only coached this team a couple years.

      <p id="ngBBgQ" class="ten"><span class="hl">He was right. The general managed to save his own ass by taking a boat across the river and escaping. Turns out this guy was kind of delusional and thought he was some incredibly important asset for the South.</span></p>

      <p id="P60egK" class="ten"><span class="hl">What’s funny about that is, when Grant was asked about that later, he said that if he’d caught him, he would have just thrown him back.

        <p id="3AQBQz" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>His name is Nick Navarro. He’s my husband, he finds a way to piss me off every goddamn day, and he’s the fastest man you’ve ever seen. In order to make it from our home field to the rest of the country, he had to run approximately five miles. He did so at a pace of three minutes, 53 seconds per mile.</p>

      <p id="Delfjp" class="manny">What he’s attempting to now, without discussing it with me first, is run a similar distance at a little over three minutes per mile. This means he needs to somehow shave off 45 seconds for every one of those five miles. He only has 16 minutes, 53 seconds of OBT.</p>

        <p id="1kaIgk" class="coache"><span class="name">Coach E: </span>SIXTEEN MINUTES?</p>

        <p id="7urOvi" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>And fifty-three seconds, yeah. I see what he did. He wanted to run on pavement. It’s the closest thing to a treadmill, that’s where he always makes the best time. We’ve been sprinting through woods for so long that actually running on pavement probably feels like a miracle. It’s like swinging a baseball bat with the donut off.</p>

      <p id="QcPYVk" class="manny">He just took the balls and ran out on me a few minutes ago. All the math in the world says he can’t do this.</p>

      <p id="qMS6dB" class="manny">But right now he’s on pace to do it. I think he’s actually gonna do it, because I know that man better than anyone, and there’s nothing he loves more than being right.</p>

      <p id="iusQch" class="coache">But that’s okay, because it taught me how good it can be sometimes to just let go. Walk away.</p>

      <p id="5vkXqF" class="radio"><strong>And if it turns out things went sideways? If we don’t have possession? Then I’ll just come out and say it: Lacrecia Evans MUST resign as head coach of Oklahoma State football.</strong></p>

      <p id="91cqeX" class="email">As you probably guessed, I’ve used up all my battery in the course of my research, and I’m about to shut down in a minute. Before I do, I want to send you a little something I call “The Story of Eugene Jennings.”</p>

      <p id="Btn2fK" class="email">As Nick and Manny were scrambling around Bumpus Mills, it sparked an old memory of a man named Eugene Jennings, sometimes known as Gene Robert Jennings, someone doing very something similar in the same place. As you know, this has been a running theme lately. It makes me feel as though we’re all living in reruns. I suppose that’s natural, though, in circumstances where land ends and time doesn’t.</p>

      <p id="bfN5xM" class="email">Anyway. I found his story extremely compelling and I hope you enjoy it. Love you both. Talk soon.</p>

      <p id="YJarI4"><span>Nine: </span>On the bank of the Cumberland River sits the Kentucky State Penitentiary.</p>

      <p id="RRUmpU">To Americans, nothing is more frightening than the past, so they built it to resemble a castle from medieval Europe.</p>

      <p id="qOemoi">It sent an intimidating, menacing message, and television networks were more than happy to produce what was essentially state propaganda to broadcast that message: These people you fear? They will suffer.&nbsp;</p>

      <p id="GQO1Z0">These are the walls between Heaven and Hell. You are on the good side.</p>

      <p id="x7cBTv">But shows like this one never, ever dared to tell us about Eugene Jennings.</p>

      <p id="MpHHSx">Back when Americans would imprison one another by the millions, KSP was among the most high-security prisons in the country. The nature of its construction, along with its surrounding geography, made escape nearly impossible.</p>

      <p id="2jPGZc">In 1958, KSP counted among its inmates 30-year-old Eugene Jennings, a.k.a. Gene Robert Jennings. He was a career criminal who had committed a scattering of robberies throughout the United States.</p>

      <p id="RmGWLC">Jennings was a man who occasionally brought a pistol to a robbery, but never fired it. He smirked in his mug shots. He enjoyed the poetry of Omar Khayyam. He might kidnap you if he really needed a ride, but he wouldn’t hurt you, and you might even walk away liking him. You might say he was not a good man, but he was by no means an evil man.</p>

      <p id="iZXAjm">He’d ended up in KSP after stealing $432 in a holdup in Louisville. He killed no one. He injured no one.</p>

      <p id="zWIxW2">The Louisville jury sentenced him to death.</p>

      <p id="dAPGPi">This sentence was later reduced to life imprisonment. Regardless, if your fellow man has agreed to have you killed over $432, what respect are you supposed to have left for them? For their institutions, their laws, their buildings?</p>

      <p id="7criSE">In December of 1958, Jennings and a fellow inmate jumped on the back of a milk truck and escaped Kentucky State Penitentiary. They had done the seemingly impossible.&nbsp;</p>

      <p id="ECaMWa">The two were picked up by a couple of thrill-seeking young guys who volunteered to drive them to St. Louis, only to find themselves shut in the trunk of their own car. Jennings made it all the way to Chicago, then to Michigan, before eventually being recaptured near Jonesville and returned to KSP.</p>

      <p id="u6i92k">Two years later, Jennings escaped again. This time, the famously athletic Jennings took a more brazen and direct approach: scaling the prison wall with his bare hands.</p>

      <p id="g6pKlC">What followed was a three-day spree of car-stealing and hostage-taking that ended with his apprehension in a barn not far away. But, as always, no one was hurt. He was even described as “courteous.”</p>

      <p id="I8pjMB">Eugene Jennings had become one of the only people ever to escape from a 20th-century, maximum-security prison multiple times.</p>

      <p id="bHlqWi">And then, in 1962, he escaped KSP a third time. This escape may have been the most embarrassing for the prison. Those stately battlements, the ones built to make the prison look like a castle? Jennings and a friend used them to catch a makeshift grappling hook they made out of bucket handles.</p>

      <p id="Pf3mfE">This time, Jennings only made it a few miles east before he was found and returned to prison. With his third jailbreak, he had broken his own record for most escapes from Kentucky State Penitentiary, a record that would stand for years.</p>

      <p id="mEGD2r">Until 1966, when he escaped a fourth time. He was described as “catlike” as he scaled the 30-foot wall yet again, and then he fled through the wilderness and demanded a ride from a man he encountered. He did not demand money, however; he asked nicely for three dollars and he received it. As always, his “hostages” had nothing bad to say about him.</p>

      <p id="aQ3Axt">Police set up roadblocks all throughout Bumpus Mills and the surrounding areas. Somehow, he snuck right through all of them. It was his greatest escape.</p>

      <p id="OGBkgp">Jennings started a new life with a new name in Atlantic City. But thanks to his fourth escape and adventures in Bumpus Mills, he was now a member of the FBI’s Most Wanted whose most damning offense at this point, it seemed, was his refusal to be jailed. After a few months, he was found and returned to KSP.</p>

      <p id="vHq3Ol">By this point, his reputation prevented him from ever getting close enough to those walls to scale them. So for his fifth and final escape, he didn’t go north, south, east, or west. He went up.</p>

      <p id="57kXdE">Jennings broke away from a guard and climbed the prison’s iconic water tower. He sat up there for two days. Maybe it was just to get his photo in the paper one last time. Perhaps he wanted to feel free, if only for a while. To feel like a man who could still wander.</p>

      <p id="yy9BMP">After 50 hours, he made his way back down, having concluded what humankind would later learn as a whole: there is nothing for them up here.</p>

      <p id="IXckbj">We can’t pretend to truly know Eugene Jennings, but he strikes me as a person meant for another time, another world where freedom is true and unconditional, where property can be forgotten. Sins can be forgiven. Failings can be embraced.</p>

      <p id="AQ96Jz">He never asked or expected to live forever. Even now, it’s hard to believe he would stay within the lines. But I know he would have loved this American sandbox.</p>

      <p id="BIU8CY">To run, to explore without consequence, to wander without meaning, to play. To love and enjoy our own world. It’s all he ever wanted.</p>

      <p id="RM0LgO">It’s all we ever wanted.</p>
