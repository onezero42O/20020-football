            found that their present technologies were entirely sufficient.

          cream. Over the course of the game, all the dribbling may eventually
          whip the cream into butter. This will surely make the basketball more
          difficult to dribble. However, the winning team will be awarded a

        <span>Juice: </span>.there’s one very important detail that i don’t
        believe y’all are aware of yet.
      </p>

      <p id="m7d2oq">
        see, intersections are crucial. suppose you’re west virginia. and you’ve
        received reliable reports that pitt has a football right …
      </p>

      <p id="wYfygS">here.</p>

      <p id="QiSM8W">
        you’ve got players sitting here at home. if you want, you can head
        south, cut north on NC A&amp;T’s field, and meet ‘em like that
      </p>

      <p id="OlLs5m">
        or you could head down a little further, take liberty’s field, and meet
        ‘em in the other direction
      </p>

      <p id="e46Z7T">
        OR if you wanna be sneaky and take your time, you can even head north on
        your own field, take maryland southeast, and charge down on ‘em.
      </p>

      <p id="ayItG8">
        you can take a practically endless number of routes, depending on what
        suits you
      </p>

      <p id="GgG2dF">
        the average team has a field that intersects dozens of times
      </p>

      <p id="DUywXX">
        even the syracuse field, one of the shortest in the game, meets with
        NCCU, howard, and buffalo
      </p>

      <p id="acB5Bq">
        this brings us to Nick and Manny, who we last saw in Atlanta
      </p>

      <p id="EDEwUv">
        they are far away from home. in fact, they play for San Diego State.
      </p>

      <p id="2AYD7W">
        their home field sits here, along SDCCU stadium. wayyyy back in the day,
        they were supposed to have a new stadium built for them, but plans fell
        through. they’ve stayed here ever since
      </p>

      <p id="uLwPnM">want to know how many intersections they have?</p>

      <p id="gGFNZv">... zero.</p>

      <p id="IAPZCL">
        the field runs into the us-mexico border, just five miles away from
        boise state’s field
      </p>

      <p id="SFDHrR">
        we surveyed it again and again and again, every time hoping we got&nbsp;
        the angle just a little bit wrong
      </p>

      <p id="1umSKR">nope</p>

      <p id="qECh5Q"></p>

      <p id="W1hhQp">
        <span>Ten: </span>.You said players aren’t allowed to leave the field.
        If that’s true, how come Nick and Manny are all the way out there?
      </p>

      <p id="CO6b42">
        <span>Juice: </span>.well, we left a little something in the rule book
        for them
      </p>

      <p id="jK5YYH">it’s not exactly a cheat. more of a&nbsp; loophole</p>

      <p id="ikCiSV">
        everyone knows about it, but no one imagines it’s possible to exploit
        right now
      </p>

      <p id="kKnx2h">
        i’ll fill y’all in on how it works. but there are&nbsp; two things you
        need to know about this scheme, if Nick and Manny can actually pull it
        off
      </p>

      <p id="Lcrtuf">
        one: it will be perhaps the greatest moment in the history of college
        football
      </p>

      <p id="j5PZXk">two: it will fuck EVERYTHING up</p>
