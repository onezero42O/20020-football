      <p id="bzcJ2C" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">well, when i first started surveying the field i was quietly hoping i’d find evidence of some kind of large-scale ancient conspiracy. i mean if all the stadiums were built at angles that pointed to the same spot, would anyone have ever noticed? seems like a really great satanic ritual</span></p>

      <p id="Qc9uk0" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Oh, that’s a new one from you. “Post-secondary education is Satanic.”</span></p>

      <p id="W0gLic" class="juice"><span class="hl">unfortunately, despite my best wishes i found no such conspiracy. in fact i was kinda disappointed by how few anomalies i found in the intersections of these lines. only got ONE single goddamn three-way intersection! you’d think that if you had 111 fields, each of which intersects with another field 20, 30, 40 times, you’d get more than that</span></p>

      <p id="g5a3tg" class="juice"><span class="hl">but you could argue that Grambling State might be the weirdest field, because they come real REAL close at several points</span></p>

      <p id="FEdpwt" class="juice"><span class="hl">see down here in the middle of the mississippi sea, Grambling State missed hittin the Iowa-Mississippi intersection by about 700 yards. which might sound like a lot, but considering their stadium’s 90 miles away that’s a very near miss</span></p>

        <p id="JaG8xX" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Well, I was interested in seeking a rule clarification. Some years back, we submitted a game plan for league approval, and it was approved. But my teammate and I were reviewing the document we submitted, and we realized that there’s a very minor discrepancy between the approved version and, you know, what we’re planning at the moment.</p>

      <p id="GAnyP8" class="nine"><span class="hl">I think it’s a celebration of the wild outcomes that originate from confines so rigid, so frustratingly letter-of-the-law, that you’d think they’d snuff out any remotely interesting outcome.</span></p>

      <p id="KvBSnP" class="nine"><span class="hl">In using the old college fields and the angles they sit along, there’s a quality of “sleep in the bed you made” that, you could argue, is the story of modern America.</span></p>

      <p id="BLjl4y" class="nine"><span class="hl">In inviting 111 teams and placing 111 footballs on the field, it ensures that it’ll take a very, very long time to play. It’s like watching a star form. Fascinating to see, boring to watch.</span></p>

      <p id="6Dhmxd" class="nine"><span class="hl">We’re all experience eternal lives, and the interminable nature of this game reminds us that for us, a long time is no time at all. Which, personally, is a reminder I’ve found very edifying.</span></p>

      <p id="MHK128" class="ten"><span class="hl">Suppose Nick and Manny were somehow able to hop directly from Georgia Tech’s field to Michigan State’s field, and take their nine footballs with them. Those nine, naturally, would add to Michigan State’s score. This is the change we’d see on the scoreboard: </span></p>

      <p id="xHlGx7" class="ten"><span class="hl">But teams only have access to scoreboards that only display the number of footballs that they THEMSELVES possess. So if you’re most teams, all you see is this:</span></p>

      <p id="Akbag2" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Well, obviously Georgia Tech lost all their footballs. Of course, I didn’t know how many they had in the first place. Twenty-five? Four? No way I can know, just based on this.</span></p>

      <p id="QyvHFZ" class="nine"><span class="hl">It’s possible that South Carolina State got them, since they moved up a spot. As an aside, this would mean that #1 Michigan State and #2 Georgia Southern are significantly out in front, since SC State adds the Tech footballs to the balls they already had and still only got to #3.</span></p>

      <p id="Rwropf" class="nine"><span class="hl">But it’s also possible that all of Tech’s footballs just fell off the field somewhere. That can happen. We saw that with the guy in the truck. Once he drove it off the field, the ball simply wasn’t reflected on the scoreboard.</span></p>

      <p id="dY2JGv" class="nine"><span class="hl">I’d go with that as the most likely scenario.</span></p>

      <p id="N2ODw5" class="nine"><span class="hl">I feel like I’m playing some kind of sinister sudoku variant.</span></p>

      <p id="RSrZms" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">But the one thing you wouldn’t automatically deduce is that Michigan State got them. Because they didn’t budge.</span></p>

      <p id="gGSlli" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">But at least they’re the only ones who actually know what’s up. Better just them than the whole country.</span></p>

      <p id="A5pSBE" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Right. And this is how hopping over to the Michigan State field would provide them with a sort of camouflage.</span></p>

      <p id="v3qBti" class="ten"><span class="hl">Obviously, they still have to get all the way across the country. But my guess is that if damn near every team in the country sees Georgia Tech just crater on the scoreboard, they’re gonna send everything they’ve got to Tech’s field, just to see if they can spot the balls sitting somewhere just off the field. Nine footballs is an enormous take, and a lot of schools have nothing better to do.</span></p>

      <p id="Pz6nyd" class="ten"><span class="hl">If THAT happens, it empties out the rest of the country, and Nick and Manny have a far less difficult time getting home.</span></p>

      <p id="6xeCcu" class="ten"><span class="hl">But again, this returns us to the central problem: Michigan State and Georgia Tech don’t intersect. Spartan Stadium and Bobby Dodd Stadium were built at almost the exact same angle.</span></p>

      <p id="ZhxWgo" class="nine"><span class="hl">Trains commonly park along this stretch, too. Conductors will hop off a train and leave it there for days. Next time a train rolls through and parks along the field, he can run down there, chuck the balls onboard, and start the engine.</span></p>

      <p id="Z6mw8u" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">So it becomes a ghost train, essentially. Nick loads it up and shoots it ten miles west to the Michigan State field, where Manny is waiting in Emory Gap.</span></p>

It’s about a 13-mile trip along the track between the two fields. And Manny’s gotta save up every second of OBT he possibly can. If the train stops even a quarter-mile too long or too short, that means Manny has to run a half-mile there and back to get the balls. Even for someone as fast as him, that’s two or three minutes.

      <p id="0QG9iq"><span>Ten: </span>.Did we guess right?</p>

      <p id="BuHiJX"><span>Juice: </span>.yep, exactly right</p>

      <p id="pQMyAJ"><span>Nine: </span>.We did it! What do we win?</p>

      <p id="yFyZHR"><span>Juice: </span>.a free copy of my self-published ebook, “wayne gets the measles”</p>

      <p id="Za7nX8"><span>Nine: </span>.Condolences to Wayne.</p>

      <p id="beo30z"><span>Juice: </span>.essentially wayne comes home from fourth grade one day feeling under the weather. alfred keeps him out of school for the next few weeks and tells him, “no crime fighting until you’re better”</p>

      <p id="XddQqe">without wayne’s shoulders to stand on, his brother bruce must crawl into the suit and fight crime all by himself</p>

      <p id="uFcOr1">he’s awful at it. his cape is way too long so he keeps trippin on it</p>

      <p id="0iTnMj">can’t see where hes goin</p>

      <p id="EOWl4Q">drives the batmobile into the side of a denny’s</p>

      <p id="tw0GvO"><span>Nine: </span>.That&nbsp; actually sounds pretty funny.</p>

      <p id="DVGPXs"><span>Juice: </span>.it’s not meant to be funny and frankly i’m a little hurt that you would say that</p>

      <p id="Tqcp4I">let’s talk about something else</p>

      <p id="KPwASo"><span>Ten: </span>.When you were writing the rule book, did you leave this train loophole on purpose?</p>

      <p id="lltaFX"><span>Juice: </span>.no! i honestly thought i made it illegal</p>

      <p id="eOwe07">Northwestern’s field runs along a train depot in chicago. some time back they approached me and argued that since you don’t steer trains, they’re legal</p>

      <p id="OqApbn">had no choice but to rule in their favor. ultimately though they couldn’t find a way to make it useful</p>

      <p id="KO6Frw"><span>Ten: </span>.Yeah, it seems like the use cases are a little bit limited.</p>

      <p id="gXSBa4"><span>Juice: </span>.this would certainly be the first effective use of a train we’ve ever seen in this game</p>

      <p id="dCSIOH">Nick’s a skilled engineer no question, but i still have my doubts about it</p>

      <p id="mR2scG"><span>Nine: </span>.There are so many unknowns. You shove something out there into the horizon, so far off you can’t see it. You have no control over where it goes.</p>

      <p id="Yt7Bin">You just hope it finds its way.</p>

      <p id="M56hB5"><span>Ten: </span>.You would know a little something about that.</p>

      <p id="6hTfyt"><span>Nine: </span>.Sure would.</p>
