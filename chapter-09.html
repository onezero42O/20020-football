      <p id="UNud0q" class="juice"><span class="hl">but they’re gonna play. what’s important for y’all to know is this</span></p>

      <p id="OJpefa" class="juice"><span class="hl">the University of Alabama-Birmingham is the greatest team in college football. and it ain’t even fuckin CLOSE. they’re better than michigan state. better than everybody. it’s been this way forever. for a while they were the top-ranked team in the country.</span></p>

      <p id="Sk6Rdj" class="juice"><span class="hl">UAB used to stomp all over the country in this giant 100-player offense. you never ever see offenses like that now. it’s like, you know how prehistoric creatures were big as fuck and got a lot smaller over time because being big as fuck wasn’t sustainable? well that’s what they were like</span></p>

      <p id="mLd7Iv" class="juice"><span class="hl">in the early days they’d pack up a couple of footballs and just go on tour all over the country, across everyone’s fields</span></p>

      <p id="BGOd9z" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">That doesn’t make any sense. Just out in the open?</span></p>

      <p id="VXqtcc" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">oh yeah. it was a damn parade is what it was</span></p>

      <p id="NPoC8m" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Sounds like an intimidation tactic.</span></p>

      <p id="oYdlab" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">eh i guess. i mean it can be useful to scare the fuck out of your opponent in some cases, but in this case it made everyone in the country get serious about carefully hiding the footballs they had. i think it kinda worked against em honestly</span></p>

      <p id="lQK5ps" class="juice"><span class="hl">they did this for fun. they were the best and they wanted everyone to know it. they wanted to bully the fuck out of every other team in the nation</span></p>

      <p id="qc607V" class="juice"><span class="hl">and you know what’s wild is, nobody could ever do anything about it. nobody could stop them and their hundred-player offense. not even with another hundred-player offense, no matter how many times they tried. Purdue sent the house after em. Wazzu. USC. Colorado. Michigan. Ohio State. everybody.</span></p>

      <p id="sRxkdM" class="juice"><span class="hl">and it was like they were all part of a christening. just glass bottles shattered against a hull. they never forced a turnover on downs or a fumble or an INT</span></p>

      <p id="vdd6Ms" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">They all fall eventually, though. Every dynasty ends. Every superpower slips up. It’s inevitable.</span></p>

      <p id="tfGhs1" class="juice"><span class="hl">no it turns out it’s not!</span></p>

      <p id="a1dz5h" class="juice"><span class="hl">UAB ran a hundred-player offense they called the Steamroller. they developed it for a couple hundred years. and when they were ready to show it to the world, you know what they did?</span></p>

      <p id="BpAHRJ" class="juice"><span class="hl">they didn’t keep it quiet</span></p>

      <p id="BFAaDS" class="juice"><span class="hl">they didn’t make their opponents spend endless nights in the film room, studying maps, trying to figure out what they were doin</span></p>

      <p id="OpSWIi" class="juice"><span class="hl">they printed out their playbook on posters and shipped em out to everybody. like “here’s what we’re doin. here’s exactly what we’re gonna do to your stupid ass. do something about it”</span></p>

      <p id="wyPsk2" class="juice"><span class="hl">QB2 was Bev. if she got the pitch, she’d make literally one read, and if it wasn’t a home run she’d get rid of it. at QB3, Cox was the same deal, except in some cases he’d cheat right. lookit</span></p>

      <p id="Pqb2iq" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">in a lot of situations they were dispatchers like Robinson, just shuttled the ball to where it needed to go. but they did some pretty fun shit in cases where they had two footballs.</span></p>

      <p id="PFPzNk" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">I’m guessing in that case, two linemen just become centers.</span></p>

      <p id="vmMtUj" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yup correct and these centers were so good at long snapping that they could direct snap it all the way back there to em if they wanted. then these two could spend all day making their reads and poppin off a throw</span></p>

      <p id="pf00Iw" class="juice"><span class="hl">ha i remember one time Astin had the ball, right? and they find a target, the receiver Walker, and throw. and then Morris pitches them the ball and they now get to try two completions on a single play, right? so they chuck it to Walker AGAIN and he catches it again. real funny to watch a receiver bring a ball down with his free hand while he’s already carrying one</span></p>

      <p id="yR09dh" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">QB7 looks like he’d have enough time to smoke a brisket.</span></p>

      <p id="Rf53MN" class="juice"><span class="hl">there’s a lot to be said about how we can’t expect human beings to change in meaningful ways. they still have marital problems and stub their toes in houses they’ve lived in for a thousand years, etc etc. at a point, expecting further improvement from people is like asking a tree to learn how to fly</span></p>

      <p id="YgGT37" class="juice"><span class="hl">but one of the things they DID get a lot better at over the last 18,000 years or so was throwing fuckin bombs. if you train and condition the right way, and if you develop the right mechanics, you can chuck it to goddam norway</span></p>

      <p id="Cy1lNj" class="juice"><span class="hl">Yamauchi’s longest completion traveled 587 yards in the air. trouble is, of course, it’s real tough to maintain accuracy over that distance. it’s dangerous and there are way safer ways to advance the ball that are just as effective. they didn’t let him throw all that often</span></p>

      <p id="tkTSA4" class="juice"><span class="hl">but most important is her ability to make reads. the other six qbs on the field were very good at this but the way Val could make her reads, it was like watching someone sitting on a park bench on a nice day, leisurely reading analyze that cover to cover</span></p>

      <p id="37UR13" class="juice"><span class="hl">i mean sometimes they would empty out most of the backfield. they’d send damn near every eligible receiver. the eight deep wideouts, the 19 standard wideouts, the tight end, eight running backs. that’s 36 reads she had to make</span></p>

      <p id="CLzQGe" class="juice"><span class="hl">but she also had lots of pocket protection. even the biggest scariest defenses took a good 30 seconds to get to her. it should not be legal for someone like Valentine to have that much time in the pocket</span></p>

      <p id="Col4D5" class="juice"><span class="hl">this quarterback enjoys the protection of several offensive lines. in this case, seven groups of five linemen</span></p>

      <p id="KFcOSO" class="juice"><span class="hl">he’s got eight wideouts on each side of the field, plus a tight end. so basically he’s got TONS and tons of time to choose between 17 eligible targets</span></p>

Yes, the quarterback gets a pocket way behind scrimmage, and he could literally take a nap back there if he wanted to. It’s also totally passive. Your receivers will run out of stuff to do and routes to run. They have to improvise.

      <p id="0avPlB" class="news">BIRMINGHAM –(WIRE REPORT)– Activist Valentine Jones has elected to suspend her campaign for United States Senate. The announcement was made from the campaign’s headquarters.</p>

      <p id="2T6DnA" class="news">“Although I’ve reached the difficult decision to suspend my campaign, I will not abandon my fight against mosquitoes.” Jones said in prepared remarks. “I remain convinced that we can and will find suitable alternative food sources for bats, birds, toads, and all of God’s creatures who feed on these bedbugs of the sky.”</p>

      <p id="NUmb6y" class="news">Jones ran as a member of the Fuck Mosquitoes party, a fringe movement dedicated to the nationwide eradication of mosquitoes. Following some key congressional wins in the mid-12300s, public support for the party has waned in favor of pro-mosquito conservationist sentiment among voters.</p>

      <p id="IS45Mq" class="news">As of Friday, Jones was polling at 14 percent.</p>

        <p id="cOLAsm" class="coach"><span class="name">Coach: </span>I mean, what for though? They’ve got 80, 90 players up there. And you know they don’t even keep their ball there.</p>

        <p id="K9GBSn" class="valentine"><span class="name">Valentine: </span>Yeah, it’s perfect. We gotta get some reps in. We got one play against Vandy, it’s not enough.</p>

        <p id="WcUj7m" class="coach"><span class="name">Coach: </span>You know how stupid that is. The job was to grab a football and bring it back north to the house.</p>

      <p id="8ATtAG" class="coach">That’s how we win. One ball at a time. That’s always been the plan. In the meantime, we run scrimmages to stay sharp. We scout out other teams and we plan for ‘em.</p>

        <p id="aGICfD" class="valentine"><span class="name">Valentine: </span>It’s not the same, you know it’s not.</p>

      <p id="u2k9hf" class="valentine">Look. We can take on ninety Indiana bums with our eight. You know we can. And you know Memorial Stadium’s a horseshoe. We won’t even have to grapple up the walls or anything, no turnstiles or gates or anything we’ll have to pass through.</p>

      <p id="lp8kgv"><span>Juice: </span>.the 21st and 22nd centuries were wild times</p>

      <p id="QtDq63">after people around the world stopped falling ill in 2026, humanity was obsessed with learning why and how this was happening</p>

      <p id="5ntzkc">of course, while other countries still found time to rebuild antarctica and build flood walls ...</p>

      <p id="y0XysT">america left the stove on</p>

      <p id="Gzd53n">it impacted everyone differently</p>

      <p id="hLO3Jw">this is how it hit alabama football</p>

      <p id="BPBlE6">now in its early days, UAB was always an afterthought, sitting in the shadow of alabama and auburn. the football program even shut down entirely for a while before everybody hollered about it and brought it back</p>

      <p id="2xHjPQ">there were plans to move to a brand-new stadium in&nbsp; 2021, but an economic crisis hit and plans fell through</p>

      <p id="m0dteL"><span>Nine: </span>.What kind of&nbsp; economic crisis?</p>

      <p id="ABezHC"><span>Juice: </span>.hell if i can remember</p>

      <p id="D7zJXL">point is, they&nbsp; had to stay put in their old ass stadium</p>

      <p id="ZjOhpn">fast-forward a few decades, and all of a&nbsp; sudden UAB is the primary standard-bearer for the most football-crazy state&nbsp; in the nation</p>

      <p id="BSO7tD">they’ve been waiting on a bowl game of this magnitude for thousands of years. naturally, when they got it, they went all in</p>

      <p id="Sp2et8">UAB recruited the top talents and scrutinized&nbsp; every yard of the field. from the jump, they were the best team in the country</p>

      <p id="3VQA4Q">but more importantly, they understood this game better than any other program</p>

      <p id="CLacQr">no matter how great&nbsp; you are, this is a game of scouting, and waiting, and staying patient. if you recover&nbsp; a football, it could be decades, even centuries, before you get another</p>

      <p id="ZsoXp5">in the meantime, if you sit&nbsp; high on the scoreboard, you become a target, right? you don’t want&nbsp; that.&nbsp; i mean look what happened to georgia tech</p>

      <p id="Htvm7H">in order to stay off the radar, UAB decided to hide their balls somewhere&nbsp; off their field. this is generally very risky and has ended in disaster for a&nbsp; few teams</p>

      <p id="YsMNFA">but you know, it’s a good thing they never moved into that new stadium.</p>

      <p id="ZXbAem">because if they did, their field wouldn’t reach ...</p>

      <p id="w00ayu">here.</p>

      <p id="yxFiMd">the Stannard&nbsp; Rock Lighthouse sits dead in the middle of lake superior, and just 200 yards from UAB’s field.</p>

      <p id="NYw9Ag">it&nbsp; is the loneliest place in America.</p>

      <p id="GAKtLE">it is remote, obsolete. abandoned, and forgotten by virtually everyone</p>

      <p id="mNmIDT">except for the University of Alabama-Birmingham football program.</p>

      <p id="HOrJJY">though you won’t see&nbsp; it on the scoreboard, they have 17 footballs, and they keep them all in this lighthouse.</p>

      <p id="cYMJPf">whenever they gain a football, they row out and drop it in.</p>

      <p id="fdLwRU"><span>Nine: </span>.This doesn’t seem safe.</p>

      <p id="ABt1B3">Someone’s gonna find it. I mean, it’s a lighthouse. Being visible is the entire point of a lighthouse.</p>

      <p id="h8qM40"><span>Juice: </span>.it’s funny, right</p>

      <p id="AM0CFX">people built a building that screams HEY IDIOT LOOK AT THIS LOOK AT ME</p>

      <p id="vS39zm">and then they forgot about it</p>

      <p id="N99yAE">it doesn’t show up on maps, and understandably, it doesn’t occur to any team to go dick around in the lake. especially out of bounds</p>

      <p id="XhfvhU">this is the genius of UAB’s game plan. everyone thinks they’re a bunch of zeroes who can’t hold on to a&nbsp; football longer than a few months.</p>

      <p id="7GMqAW">but THEY know they’re winning. they’re the fastest, strongest, and smartest, and they keep all their assets under the table</p>

      <p id="plk2lm">they’re gonna win this and they know it</p>

      <p id="QQZECW"><span>Nine: </span>.Roll Tide.</p>

      <p id="jMMCTl"><span>Juice: </span>.roll damn tide</p>
