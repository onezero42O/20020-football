        <p id="Cx8RcP" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>He’s just got a case of kennel cough. Have you boarded him anywhere recently?</p>

        <p id="02M6Ko" class="petowner"><span class="name">Pet Owner: </span>No, not for a while.</p>

        <p id="JVIkhU" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Come in contact with any other dogs?</p>

        <p id="4ACum1" class="petowner"><span class="name">Pet Owner: </span>No, not really. He sniffs other dogs on his walks sometimes, actually.</p>

        <p id="h4DLng" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Do you go on walks with him?</p>

        <p id="3ddYvg" class="petowner"><span class="name">Pet Owner: </span>He usually just goes around the block by himself.</p>

        <p id="eecghM" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Well, he’s contagious right now, so you may wanna, and I hate to say this, but you might wanna put him on a leash for the next couple weeks. Just to make sure he doesn’t–</p>

      <p id="9CM2fQ" class="mimi">Hey!</p>

      <p id="vJfpYd" class="mimi">Hey get from under there! There’s medical waste in that bin, he doesn’t need to stick his nose in there.</p>

        <p id="i8t2vV" class="petowner"><span class="name">Pet Owner: </span>Rudy! Sorry about that. He’s always been hard-headed. I know he knows, too.</p>

        <p id="oURQaJ" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>They never get old.</p>

        <p id="h863H5" class="petowner"><span class="name">Pet Owner: </span>Never ever.</p>

        <p id="S1O1nw" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>So what we can do is, Carrie at the desk can get you a scrip for some antibiotics. It comes in a dropper and you should have enough for seven days. It’s actually a little sweet, so he’ll probably take it just fine. But if you have any trouble you can just mix it in with his dinner.</p>

        <p id="lIS1rK" class="lizzie"><span class="name">Lizzie: </span>Mimi! Got a call on two.</p>

        <p id="wt2Dzz" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Thank you!</p>

      <p id="98NLhk" class="mimi">You should be all set.</p>

        <p id="jKqtdZ" class="petowner"><span class="name">Pet Owner: </span>Ugh, he’s gonna hate that leash. We need to go pick one up, any tips?</p>

        <p id="GbVDSx" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Only ones I recommend against are the retractable leashes, they tend to send mixed messages. You want one with a fixed length, especially since he’s not used to it. Needs to know his boundaries. Make sure he keeps some distance from other pups if you can.</p>

        <p id="7pRNbu" class="petowner"><span class="name">Pet Owner: </span>Oh okay, yeah that makes sense.</p>

      <p id="a4iYhD" class="petowner">Come on, bud. Thanks Mimi! Say bye!</p>

        <p id="n8w20M" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Bye, little man! Too cute.</p>

      <p id="nUAejW" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">basically the story goes, a man named Grimaldi is feeling depressed. way down in the dumps. so he goes to see a doctor</span></p>

      <p id="vjlxWN" class="juice"><span class="hl">and the doctor says, “ah, i have just the cure for you! you must go into town and see Grimaldi the clown! he can really put on a show. i was just there the other night and laughed the entire time. yes sir, Grimaldi the clown will cheer you right up!”</span></p>

      <p id="FF5Stv" class="juice"><span class="hl">and Grimaldi responds, “that is also my name! what a coincidence! i’ll go see him tonight!” and he goes and has a great time and feels a lot better</span></p>

        <p id="N1lS1l" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>I’m Mimi. So nice to talk to you! The commish said you just woke up.</p>

      <p id="BrNH2Q" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">At the end of September, yeah.</span></p>

        <p id="cNCJhn" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>What’s that like? Is it tough getting your bearings again?</p>

      <p id="H3vElU" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Actually, not really. It was a lot better this time. The first time was back in 17776, that was way tougher.</span></p>

        <p id="qpec7W" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Mhmm, I remember that. Juice has told me a lot about it.</p>

      <p id="Tc5aQv" class="mimi">They spent a lot of time looking for you. Lot of time. He told me that at one point, they were sure you were gone for good. But then your sister kept lookin’ and lookin’, and I guess she found you.</p>

      <p id="B9VU4Q" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Yeah, sometimes I can’t believe she did it. Not counting the booms, I’m about three feet tall and three feet wide.</span></p>

        <p id="RKIZmH" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Oh wowwww. I would’ve guessed you were a lot larger than that. I guess I hear “space probe” and I think “spaceship.”</p>

      <p id="TaTDWS" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Yeah, Juice is a whole lot bigger than I am. Not that it matters, really. We all feel pretty tiny out here.</span></p>

        <p id="Oj0WOI" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>I do too sometimes. This field’s about 134,000 miles long in total, enough to go around the globe five times.</p>

      <p id="3GrYVA" class="mimi">I guess for him that’s the closest he can get to eating, other than sucking up the sunbeams. It makes me a little sad for him sometimes.</p>

        <p id="OxWqhQ" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Yeah, you know, every so often. He loves to make friends. With the players in particular. You know you’re his friend if he drops the whole Commish thing and talks to you like normal.</p>

      <p id="gdrFS5" class="mimi">Honestly? I think part of the reason he made this game was so he could have friends.</p>

      <p id="RQa48x" class="mimi">But you know, no matter who you are, if you get a job somewhere on the field, people are always gonna be like, “ohhh, you play football. You’re just trying to be cute about it.” And if they notice you never leave the field, they’ll figure you out.</p>

      <p id="L1nN8p" class="mimi">I can’t do any of the normal stuff. I can’t drive a car, I can’t take the bus. And no matter what, if you cross a highway on foot, people are always gonna look at you funny. Even if there’s a crosswalk. Doesn’t matter.</p>

      <p id="pawAaJ" class="mimi">&lt;Hiiii! Good, I’m doing good. Could you get me a fish sandwich, pickles, no tartar sauce, and do y’all have fries in the fryer? OK great. And then just a medium Sprite.&gt;</p>

      <p id="Z0vdcV" class="mimi">Damn, that was fun.</p>

      <p id="Ojpq6S" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Opening day?</span></p>

        <p id="nOapbP" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Yeah. I wasn’t on the team back then, I actually didn’t commit to Southern until about eight hundred years ago. It was on every channel, though. Every team had 125 players, you know, and they all started on their home fields. It looked like one of those fun runs. Everybody just bookin’ it out of the stadium at once.</p>

      <p id="5JeFbE" class="mimi">My mother was on the Southern track team way back when, so she signed up as a defensive back. The program’s playbook at the start was basically to just wait for other teams to pop footballs loose, then close in on ‘em once they were out in the open. It wasn’t a bad idea. I mean, this field has 78 intersections.</p>

      <p id="ArQ8aP" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Yeah, and if you stay to your home field, you actually get to work all 125 of your players into the playbook, right? Including the 25 who have to stay on the home field.</span></p>

        <p id="X1TfMJ" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Exactly, exactly. So what they did is, they broke into eight teams of 11. One each for Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. Three for Texas, two for New Mexico, two for Arizona. That left another 37 players left over, and those 37 just scouted various other fields. That’s a lot more scouts than more teams use. They served as sort of an early-warning system to let the rest of the team know when an offense was rolling in with a ball.</p>

      <p id="31Uanr" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Did it work?</span></p>

        <p id="YgT0wu" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>For a while, yeah! It worked pretty good. In Year Two they picked up a ball in Texas. Year 77 they got another, Year 190 they got another.</p>

        <p id="xhtSgL" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Dallas was a real hot part of the field back then. A lot of big programs have fields running through it. Texas, TCU, Baylor, Nebraska has one that comes all the way down. They called it “Powerball.” Footballs were just bouncing around all over. Of course, since Southern only had 11 players in the area, they were usually squeezed out of the action.</p>

      <p id="uxSvzB" class="mimi">One day, though.</p>

      <p id="3eaQIi" class="mimi">One day, those 11 wake up one morning and see they’ve moved up on the scoreboard. Someone’s trying to carry a football through their field. Who knows where, you know, but Mama goes up to a rooftop to see if there’s anything to see.</p>

      <p id="iiNStG" class="mimi">And sure enough, she sees a TCU team stomping their way. Not even trying to be quiet about it, the way you might if you’re on another team’s field. There were about 70 of ‘em. And they just thought they were all that, you know?</p>

      <p id="2LbArU" class="mimi">Southern didn’t like that. So they said, hell, let’s make ‘em work for it at least. Let’s line ‘em up and make ‘em play some football if they’re gonna just parade through our field like this.</p>

      <p id="Tl6xRM" class="mimi">When they do, TCU’s all crabby about it. They’re annoyed. So they line up in a, excuse me but I’m gonna curse here, they line up in a “fuck-you” formation.</p>

        <p id="3bXnO7" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>They line up in what they call the phalanx. The idea is that the whole team just marches forward and bulldozes everybody, slowly but surely. And the quarterback just kinda strolls along behind em.</p>

      <p id="s5NfbA" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Yeah, I’m looking up the replay. This is gross.</span></p>

        <p id="DfhAMX" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>It’s some real knucklehead stuff. It’s basically what you do if you wanna completely disrespect somebody. If you’re a big team who runs into a little team and you just wanna make ‘em feel like dirt for even trying to challenge you.</p>

      <p id="h1zHJy" class="mimi">And it went about as you’d guess. Southern put ten players on the line, but it didn’t matter. They just got trampled. Mama said it was so slow, it was like watching road getting paved.</p>

      <p id="HHdbAp" class="mimi">But you know, there’s a saying. Every coach says it now. “Count your opponent.” No matter what, no matter how outmatched they are, count your opponent.</p>

      <p id="iojCWp" class="mimi">And this is why they say that.</p>

        <p id="td6zQD" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Mama told me later she was scared as Hell on that rooftop. Nobody wants to jump off an 18-story building. I don’t care how good the nanos are at what they do, it’s gonna hurt some. And it’s not like you can jump a couple hundred feet and just decide it won’t scare you.</p>

      <p id="cqgZxm" class="mimi">But she’s there to play, and she’s the only Southern player in Dallas who has long jump experience. So she walks out her steps, kinda like a placekicker would, and starts way back on the rooftop. She listens for the snap count. And of course, because TCU just wanted to disrespect Southern, their snap count was just a countdown from ten to one.</p>

      <p id="TSmyLD" class="mimi">Nobody does that. Not anymore, not ever.</p>

      <p id="6i1lV8" class="mimi">Her plan was to jump the line. From way back on the roof, she couldn’t actually see ‘em. So once she heard the count get down to five, she started running.</p>

      <p id="l00yHy" class="mimi">A little after it got to two, she made the jump.</p>

      <p id="Wmws6w" class="mimi">And the <em>instant</em> the ball was snapped, she crossed the line of scrimmage.</p>

        <p id="f9TasG" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>When there’s an impact like that, the nanos kinda bubble up around you and sweep you backward.

      <p id="cuGMOb" class="mimi">TCU’s quarterback quit after that. Said the terror of it was too much for him. He walked right off the field, right then and there, and never came back.</p>

      <p id="5LQSTk" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Does Southern still have that ball?</span></p>

        <p id="g8qgyV" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>No. No telling where it is.</p>

      <p id="9q3eT9" class="mimi">We had a little mini-dynasty back then. Actually had seven footballs at one time, which was a whole lot back then. But that just made us a target.</p>

      <p id="kHJ4bU" class="mimi">Georgia State’s always hated us, always. And about 700 years into the game, they gave us the bulldozer. You know what that is?</p>

        <p id="SK7liR" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>The bulldozer is about the meanest thing you can do in football. It’s only been done a couple times. It’s technically legal, but it’s so unsportsmanlike that every team in the country came together at some point and agreed never to do it.</p>

      <p id="HifXEf" class="mimi">When you bulldoze somebody, you take all one hundred of your standard players and you put them on someone else’s field. Those players start at one end, mark off a distance of 100 yards, and search those hundred yards up and down. One player per yard. Every player just paces from sideline to sideline, combing every square inch, kicking over every rock and bucket and everything else.</p>

      <p id="YgRjWi" class="mimi">They do that for an hour. Then they move upfield and do the same for the next hundred yards. Twelve hours a day, this is all they did.</p>

      <p id="nxXuJl" class="mimi">They did this on our field for seven years.</p>

      <p id="KFJXIz" class="mimi">Now If a team is bulldozing your field, you can send your own team after ‘em, try to slow ‘em down. But then they’ve successfully tied your team up. The door’s wide open for some other team to come in and rob you.</p>

      <p id="0Di8o4" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Did they find any footballs doing that?</span></p>

        <p id="PgQNhe" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>That’s the thing. They didn’t. But by doing that, they forced us to scramble, to take our footballs and run off to other fields. From there, we were eventually picked off, one after another.</p>

      <p id="XeC94Y" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Oh, so that’s why you keep them all on your field! For the ranking! So you can recruit.</span></p>

        <p id="Yxr3eD" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Exactly right, that’s exactly right. By the 20400s I expect us to be the #1 team in the country. We’re in great shape to make a run, I think.</p>

      <p id="EDKXLD" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Can I ask where you’re hiding them?</span></p>

        <p id="SiqJRg" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Underwater, in the middle of the lake right near the Mississippi-Louisiana border. I keep them in an old silo down there. Of course, I swim down there and check on ‘em once a month or so. Don’t need ‘em workin’ loose and floating all over the lake.</p>

      <p id="1g3WJQ" class="mimi">You know what cracks me up about y’all? It’s how great at conversation you are. Commish had to learn how to be social over the years, but you haven’t been up that long, right?</p>

      <p id="DpEtSt" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Well</span></p>

      <p id="putlyD" class="nine"><span class="hl">There’s the me who’s been conscious for a total of a few weeks or so, but then there’s the me who kind of ambiently absorbed transmissions from Earth for all those thousands of years.</span></p>

        <p id="7aUwzz" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>Oh, TV shows and whatnot? Talk radio?</p>

      <p id="4F0QJf" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Yeah.</span></p>

      <p id="S1Qy23" class="nine"><span class="hl">But there’s the third me, too. The one who absorbed things before I fully really existed as me. I was just a bucket of instruments.</span></p>

      <p id="g7iyrL" class="nine"><span class="hl">The onboard memory I launched into space with is core rope memory. You know how that works?</span></p>

        <p id="u6perS" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>No idea.</p>

      <p id="2TUJMK" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Well, those of us who were built in the ‘60s presented a problem. Traditional data storage was really fragile and unreliable. And if it messed up, it wasn’t as though they could go out there and fix me.</span></p>

      <p id="PjaO0N" class="nine"><span class="hl">So they literally sewed me some memory. I still have it, of course. It’s all these bundles of thin little wires sewn into a board. If a wire is sewn through a little ring, that’s a one. If it passes outside the ring, it’s a zero.</span></p>

      <p id="JQi5lE" class="ninefading"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">It took, and I apologize in advance for cursing—</span></p>

        <p id="LFTyr2" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>No, no problem.</p>

      <p id="acrmYV" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">They had to literally sew the program into the board, strand by strand. Two of them would sit opposite from one another and check each other’s work. If you made even one error out of countless thousands upon thousands – if you mistakenly looped even a single zero instead of a one – the entire thing was ruined. The steadiness of hand it required, the artistry, the unreasonable attention to detail it took, I can’t even begin to imagine.</span></p>

      <p id="GxntS5" class="ninefading"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Of course, this isn’t rewritable memory, the sort of memory you usually think of. Everything was hardwired.</span></p>

      <p id="3rEWdH" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">What no one quite understood at the time is that everything makes an imprint, however atomic or faint it might be.</span></p>

      <p id="rFaCv3" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Right, because they shot us in space shortly thereafter. There was nothing out here to erode it.</span></p>

      <p id="MH9jYB" class="nine"><span class="hl">So, you know, fast-forward thousands of years, I wake up, and I have nothing to do but sort through these mountains upon mountains of imprints that are all over me. In a sense, I got to “hear” what people were saying while they were around me, or at least, the collection of parts that became me.</span></p>

      <p id="MXCEKR" class="nine"><span class="hl">They talked about a lot of things. A lot about their children. A lot of telling each other they were taking a lunch break. That’s something I came to understand very early on: people love lunch. They interrupt everything they’re doing just for lunch.</span></p>

        <p id="Z6NJTh" class="mimi"><span class="name">Mimi: </span>I can’t blame ‘em. Making you sounds like it’s hard work.</p>

      <p id="PJM3AD" class="ninefading"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Yeah.</span></p>

      <p id="VG1cgJ" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">I sort of think of them as my godparents, all of those people who built me. The researchers at Ames, the technicians at Cape Kennedy, those women in the factory.</span></p>

      <p id="cDLtnQ" class="mimi">It was a stop on the Underground Railroad. There’s a creek that runs behind the building. The ones who escaped had to follow the creek north to find it, it was about the only way you could make it through this part of Ohio without being seen.</p>

      <p id="0CW4zQ" class="mimi">And you know how tired they must have been. I don’t think I’ll ever know what it’s like to be that tired. When they got here, they got a meal, and they could sleep in the attic or the cellar before making it the rest of the way to Canada.</p>

      <p id="0imXTs" class="mimi">One day I’ll knock on the door and visit. For now, I can only get close. I can see it through the trees, it’s a bright brick building you can make out from far off. It’s enough for me.</p>

      <p id="H9VOXo" class="mimi">This is all just based on things I’ve looked up, but he and his wife, his wife’s name was Maria, and they supposedly made the best food anywhere. People would come from miles and miles around, trying to beat the sunset and get there in time for dinner.</p>

      <p id="3SxW9f" class="mimi">The whole town sprang up around those two.</p>

      <p id="eihJl3" class="mimi">The tavern’s not there anymore, but right at the edge of the Alabama A&amp;M field, there’s a church.</p>

      <p id="dq6gf3"><span>Ten: </span>.What do you think?</p>

      <p id="fSVgeN"><span>Juice: </span>.well</p>

      <p id="6XgwZv">...</p>

      <p id="dSWsfQ">would lunchables fondue have been feasible? absolutely it was! absolutely it was! we need only cite dunkaroos, which</p>

      <p id="gHvc2E"><span>Ten: </span>.SHH</p>

      <p id="EJbc9J"><span>Juice: </span>.ok yeah i see what’s goin&nbsp; on. Nine’s been burnin energy at a rate higher than usual</p>

      <p id="BQp9D6"><span>Ten: </span>.Probably all the historical research they’ve been doing. That can chew up the battery.</p>

      <p id="coYHqZ"><span>Juice: </span>.yup. we gotta shut down the Stanford antenna and reset it</p>

      <p id="v4ujLd">after that i think what we do is, i shoot over a quick charge, Nine stays online for a little while longer, then we let their battery completely run out so they can do a full charge</p>

      <p id="0LF3eE">once that’s done, Nine can wake up for another full cycle&nbsp;</p>

      <p id="7uJ8DM"><span>Ten: </span>.How long do you think that’ll take?</p>

      <p id="ZRme2i"><span>Juice: </span>.in this particular case, a few months</p>

      <p id="zCgwdJ"><span>Ten: </span>.I just don’t want them to miss Nick and Manny.</p>

      <p id="MvYDdY">If they score and Nine isn’t around for it, they’ll be heartbroken.</p>

      <p id="x3SqQl"><span>Juice: </span>.the timing of this could work actually. it’ll take those few months for them to get across the country anyway</p>

      <p id="c793mV">i bet i can get&nbsp; Nine up and runnin by late winter, early spring, sometime around then</p>

      <p id="UbmcRI"><span>Ten: </span>.Sounds good to me.</p>

      <p id="1BuAOI"><span>Juice: </span>.next of kin approves, papers signed, let’s go in</p>

      <p id="2Vs25j"></p>

      <p id="ohTqFN">hmmmmmmmmmm</p>

      <p id="STUObP">looks like nasa put a lock on the Stanford antenna at some point</p>

      <p id="AqF4kQ">we need an access key. gotta enter seven values</p>

      <p id="SXe4KS"></p>

      <p id="sVQ3WO">when’s the last time nasa and nine made contact</p>

      <p id="S6DCLV"></p>

      <p id="c5eghv"><span>Ten: </span>.Conventionally, you mean? May 18th, 1983.</p>

      <p id="XqoIfy">.uhhhhhh</p>

      <p id="ZqiNJ9"></p>

      <p id="dXIIxi">god how do you shut down Stanford</p>

      <p id="spJdmd"></p>

      <p id="6vY9R4"></p>

      <p id="7sYmFs">OH</p>

      <p id="FNlsLc">HEY</p>

      <p id="SP2o86">as of may 1983, what’s the most recent game Stanford played</p>

      <p id="a7WQJ4"><span>Ten: </span>.THE CAL GAME!!!</p>

      <p id="ninAG5">Oh shit oh shit oh shit</p>

      <p id="KSeqpM">OK I got it.</p>

      <p id="XcQLT0"><span>Juice: </span>.hit me with the uniform numbers</p>

      <p id="wvKxlQ"></p>

      <p id="e1XHLn"><span>Nine: </span>.There we go.</p>

      <p id="VoeATh"><span>Juice: </span>.HEY how’s my favorite space bucket</p>

      <p id="k7KNaP"><span>Nine: </span>.Good! Everything’s back online. Thank you.</p>

      <p id="hsccZw"><span>Ten: </span>.Nine! Hey.</p>

      <p id="UqFYBs">...</p>

      <p id="Mus3u5">We had to make a tough call. You’ve only got enough charge to stay online for a little longer, but</p>

      <p id="d8jGlz"><span>Nine: </span>.I know, I heard. It’s fine.</p>

      <p id="CbNe2m">I can come back next year?</p>

      <p id="8KRv5z"><span>Ten: </span>.Yep.</p>

      <p id="rmjnor"><span>Nine: </span>.That’s all I need, really.</p>

      <p id="3RRHDz">Nick and Manny ought to be somewhere out west by then. I can’t miss that.</p>

      <p id="o6KFpe"><span>Juice: </span>.um</p>

      <p id="8Q586a">about that y’all</p>

      <p id="puKfbW">i think they’re in trouble</p>

      <p id="fQglGg"><span>Ten: </span>.Hold on. Tracking.</p>

      <p id="NoSejI"></p>

      <p id="782PXO"></p>
