        <p id="NKrVJN" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>I’m thinking, look. I’m thinking we both head south and wait right at the edge of the WKU field. We sit a few days and we wait for other teams to pass on through.</p>

      <p id="0Cj4Mf" class="nick">Then we can meet up again. Soon as we’ve let a few teams pass on their way to Tech, you and me meet back up and head northwest on WKU. I know we talked about heading up to Iowa before we cut west, but I’m saying don’t fuck with any of that. We gotta get these balls cross-country fast as we fuckin’ can. You know?</p>

      <p id="ykS6Xw" class="nick">I think we just cut west on Oklahoma State and run our asses straight to Stillwater, meet up with Mike and them at Grambling there. That’s a lot of time to spend on one field, but fuck it. The west was pretty empty to start with.</p>

      <p id="APFF7m" class="nick">And there’s just two of us. We can hide if someone comes through. Probably up in a tree somewhere, if we have to.</p>

      <p id="Fztl3C" class="nick">You know?</p>

        <p id="cnO5WM" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Plus, I issued a challenge. They say they can give me back those 10 seconds of OBT, they said it was a scorer’s error.</p>

        <p id="7yy99B" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>It’s the only way I could’ve done it, Manny. Only way.</p>

        <p id="pa0CyR" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>You know it wasn’t.</p>

        <p id="aCJkuu" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Look, you gotta trust me to throw. You said you trusted me to make the throw.</p>

      <p id="Y6eDPg" class="nick">I tried to do the math with all the cars on it and there was just too much involved. Way more weight, that could make it coast too long. Way more wheels, that’s way more resistance. There was no way I could … I had to simplify.</p>

      <p id="4VmMpu" class="nick">Like, I had to feel it. The engine and three cars, I can’t get a grip on that. But if it’s just the engine, that I felt like I could.</p>

        <p id="VPW3Eo" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>You punked out. You fuckin’ punked out on that shit.</p>

        <p id="cjxWRL" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Mike tell you to do that shit?</p>

        <p id="767Wra" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>I mean not exactly, no.</p>

        <p id="nPV4c9" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>I don’t understand why you, if breaking off the cars was such a big deal, I don’t understand why you can’t just break off the uh. The connector thing.</p>

        <p id="ioXcnB" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>The coupler. I told you! I already told you why I couldn’t do that. With these new ones you can only do it from the cab. There’s no release on the coupler itself, you gotta do it remotely.</p>

      <p id="TDrrql" class="nick">And it just took me a minute! For the whole thing to boot up and all. It just took me a minute.</p>

        <p id="LSjI5j" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Yeah! Literally a minute! More than that! You needed every second of that to cross the desert.</p>

      <p id="cXxC4m" class="manny">You and me, we’re a team, you know? We make decisions together. You have no right to just pop off and do shit like that.</p>

        <p id="DRyVxl" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>I know, I just knew that–</p>

        <p id="fWyTK8" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>I mean what the fuck am I gonna do without you, Nick? If I can make it home but you can’t?</p>

        <p id="gJSpw8" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>I still can. I still can try.</p>

        <p id="4Tzm3q" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Yeah, with fuckin’, what’s the math? You’re gonna run five 3:20 miles?</p>

        <p id="HdjfKA" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>I mean you know I’ve been training.</p>

        <p id="8YXW1n" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Yeah, on the treadmill in Atlanta. In air conditioning. Running flat. And you still couldn’t hit that.</p>

        <p id="AGtLO5" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>But look at you, though. You’re still gonna have almost all your time. I mean look what I did for you! I made a fuckin’ miracle happen and I’m like, you’re puttin’ me in the shit here! And I pulled off a fuckin’ miracle!</p>

        <p id="3OOlId" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>Did for ME?</p>

      <p id="M84w02" class="manny">Best thing you coulda did for me was keeping your time! Giving me a partner! Givin’ me my fucking husband!</p>

        <p id="zd6PSc" class="nick"><span class="name">Nick: </span>Look, come on.</p>

        <p id="mlF1Q9" class="manny"><span class="name">Manny: </span>I mean what happens if Coach calls you back? I bet if I was Coach, I’d look at your time and be like no, you gotta wait. You gotta wait on the field another hundred years. And then she’d make me try and run it by myself.</p>

      <p id="heumxQ" class="manny">Babe, I don’t wanna do a hundred years without you.</p>

        <p id="XVLmX6" class="organizer"><span class="name">Organizer: </span>Hi everybody, if I could please get everybody’s attention?</p>

      <p id="0pYXsb" class="organizer"></p>

      <p id="CiUVaQ" class="organizer"></p>

      <p id="nziG4K" class="organizer"></p>

      <p id="6aot8Q" class="organizer">Thank you.</p>

      <p id="i64kHJ" class="organizer">I’d just like to welcome everybody to game night at the Ilinois Chess Club. This is the first night of the fall season, and I’m happy to see so many new faces!</p>

      <p id="Rk6Cp1" class="organizer">I think some of you have already met her, but if you haven’t, I’d like to announce that we’ve got a celebrity in the room tonight! Over there at table number seven, we’ve got Lori Irving as a special guest. Lori’s a college football player with Texas A&amp;M, if everyone could give her a hand!</p>

      <p id="YM3RKO" class="organizer"></p>

      <p id="PShXwA" class="organizer"></p>

      <p id="bdn33S" class="organizer">Lori, how familiar are you with Illinois chess?</p>

        <p id="1foiAt" class="lori"><span class="name">Lori: </span>Hi, uh, actually, this is my first time playing Illinois chess. I’ve played some standard chess tournaments, but this is a new one for me. I’m sure I’ll pick up the rules as I go.</p>

        <p id="exMtTC" class="organizer"><span class="name">Organizer: </span>Well, we’re so happy you’re here, and I hope you enjoy the Illinois variant. What brings you to Illinois? Unless you don’t want to leak too much of the playbook!</p>

        <p id="u709RM" class="lori"><span class="name">Lori: </span>Oh no, not a problem at all! I’m playing prevent for Texas A&amp;M. I was just assigned to this position a couple years ago.</p>

        <p id="RmHxEO" class="organizer"><span class="name">Organizer: </span>And I know we’ve got a lot of football fans in the room, but for those who aren’t familiar, what does it mean to play prevent?</p>

        <p id="SJa4Ln" class="lori"><span class="name">Lori: </span>Well, Northern Illinois is one of the fields we think of as sort of the gateway to the west. It runs north-south, and my job is to patrol up and down the field, and sort of be ready to try to make an interception if someone tries to bring a football out west. Or, if there’s a whole team and I can’t take ‘em on, I’ll just scout ‘em out and let my teammates know.</p>

        <p id="f3xxVw" class="organizer"><span class="name">Organizer: </span>So you’re playing chess in the middle of a football game! I guess you can do it all, huh?</p>

        <p id="V0V4rz" class="lori"><span class="name">Lori: </span>Ha, well, we’ll see. Wish me luck.</p>

        <p id="exDJDL" class="organizer"><span class="name">Organizer: </span>Of course. Good luck to Lori and to everyone else here.</p>

      <p id="GILmzR" class="organizer">And I think everyone’s aware, but I’m obligated to let everyone know, just for the record, this building is on Northern Illinois’ field. We don’t expect any disruptions, and we’ve never run into a situation like that, but if there is football coming through the area and we’ve got action in here, I’ve received approval from the Illinois Chess Association to suspend matches or nullify results. If there were to be any disruption in play, I’d meet with both players of each match and find a resolution that works for everybody.</p>

      <p id="Ww99m8" class="organizer">All right, that’s all from me. Unless there are any questions?</p>

      <p id="KtUKGh" class="organizer"></p>

      <p id="jzZbps" class="organizer"></p>

      <p id="bn0wh6" class="organizer">Okay, great. I’ll be here in case anyone has any questions or needs any rule clarifications. Have a good match, everyone!</p>

        <p id="C4QHTZ" class="chessguy"><span class="name">Chess Guy: </span>Good luck.</p>

        <p id="orCmo1" class="lori"><span class="name">Lori: </span>Good luck!</p>

        <p id="UHkz4r" class="chessguy"><span class="name">Chess Guy: </span>Well, now I can charge rent on this square. It’s 10 percent. So if you ever move a piece to Joliet, you have to pay me 40 dollars every turn you spend on it.</p>

        <p id="se8jI6" class="chessguy"><span class="name">Chess Guy: </span>Nah, not really. It’s pretty much just the biggest cities in the middle, then kinda just spirals out into smaller towns.</p>

        <p id="aVILNq" class="chessguy"><span class="name">Chess Guy: </span>We’re not sure of the exact year, but around 100 B.C., a bunch of colonists from Greece, some Phoenicians, and some people from northern Africa fled the old world with a bunch of treasure, and that included the remains of Ptolemy, Cleopatra, and Alexander the Great. They sailed their ships up through the Mississippi River, then started exploring the land. Eventually they got to Illinois and found some caves around here, and evidently they thought it was the perfect place to hide the treasure.</p>

But ask yourself this: if it’s a hoax, how come every time you ask someone in Iuka about Alexander the Great, every single one of ‘em will tell you his bones are nearby?

      <p id="1gUjx3" class="chessguy">I’ve got a lot more stuff about the ancient hidden treasure cave I could tell you. There’s other variants to this game we could play too. Like there’s an expansion set where if you land on Chicago, the game transfers to another board that represents Cook County. And you’re awarded a new type of piece called the Councilman who like, you roll a set of dice and however many you roll is how many spaces the Councilman moves. Personally I don’t think it’s a very strong piece, but there are some strong players who play up in the Rockford chapter who have found some interesting ways to utilize it. Since the Vizier moves both horizontally and vertically, it’s a good way to establish control of a given rank or file, especially in the early game, when you typically haven’t developed your Rooks yet. The Vizier, on the other hand, starts the game on the second rank with the pawns, so you can immediately seize control of a rank or file, even if you can’t do so with much precision. There’s no way of knowing how many spaces the dice will let you move, but it does discourage your opponent from stepping into its field of attack. Of course, the Cook County board is about ten feet wide and even though you get 304 pieces and 304 pawns, you only get one Vizier. So essentially it’s a gimmick option in the vast majority of options. I usually just sacrifice my Vizier early in the game so I can set up a strong pawn structure in the Cicero area of the board. Or Skokie, depending on how the game’s going. Or wait, I’ve been saying Vizier instead of Councilman. Did I say Vizier? Anyways, it used to be called the Vizier but it’s the Councilman in the new version. I’ve actually got both versions at my house so we could play either one. There’s no actual difference between the two versions except in one of them the special piece is called the Vizier and in the other newer version, it’s called the Councilman.</p>

      <p id="P34xlj"><span>Nine: </span>.I’ve been reading up on this theory. I can’t help myself.</p>

      <p id="DnwUUn">So as the story goes, people from around the Mediterranean casually scooped up the remains of Alexander the Great and Cleopatra, which of course is a very easy thing to do, then sailed across the Atlantic, navigated through the Caribbean, found the Mississippi Delta, sailed north, disembarked there for some reason, and decided that future Illinois, of all places, was where they buried them.</p>

      <p id="murlV3"><span>Juice: </span>.yeah a settlement needs three things nearby to thrive:</p>

      <p id="4TsbGZ">fresh water</p>

      <p id="ZYfWc7">white castle</p>

      <p id="Mk4btq">krystal</p>

      <p id="AZU3nf">to argue that they would have bypassed the shared-slider territory of the tennessee valley, only to settle in exclusively steamed-burger lands, is absurd</p>

      <p id="AINYIz"></p>

      <p id="ovizo6"><span>Nine: </span>.People believe this shit?</p>

      <p id="SgTlog"><span>Ten: </span>.We’re talking about a handful of people, but yeah.</p>

      <p id="waQWL4"></p>

      <p id="w063El"><span>Nine: </span>.I wonder what motivates that.</p>

      <p id="5MHxMV"><span>Ten: </span>.In this particular case, a couple of things are going on. First, some hucksters invented a story to try to make a buck.</p>

      <p id="ZWN1EJ">Second, it’s a sort of origin story that latched on with some who really need to feel like people from the old world are&nbsp; supposed to be here.</p>

      <p id="dcpQX5">But more broadly, I think ...</p>

      <p id="dIXMI8">A consequence of stealing land is that you will never find the significance of it. Whatever lies you made up to justify your crimes will fade away.</p>

      <p id="DfiFxW">There are lots of people who grew up down there&nbsp; in a&nbsp; society that was missing spirit, purpose, anything sacred.</p>

      <p id="9tPUQl">Some feel that&nbsp; they’ve found it iin this eternal paradise. Others have concluded that they’ll never find it, and have come to peace with&nbsp; that.</p>

      <p id="V2KfVV">And then there are some who, in this post-consequence existence, need to assign the sort of historical importance here that they see in Paris, or Addis Ababa, or Bangkok.</p>

      <p id="2m1NcE"><span>Juice: </span>.it’s here in abundance, of course. it’s just the history that they choose not to think about</p>

      <p id="POwamI">i thought about that a lot when i worked on this game. i spent years negotiating with various people and properties along these fields. a lot of Native American tribes gave permission to players to pass through their lands. some didn’t</p>

      <p id="l9eMyp">remember the game in Georgia a couple weeks back? with those beautiful bums who threw the football on the highway?</p>

      <p id="kousSx">i bet you anything they didn’t know this, but Ball Ground, Georgia is the site the Cherokee&nbsp; people once used to play games of stickball</p>

      <p id="mN2kkF">by incredible coincidence, if you continue southwest on the Clemson field, you find Ballplay, Alabama, where the Cherokee did the same. here they played stickball to resolve disputes</p>

      <p id="L4SumK">it was a rough game. injuries abounded. but it was a genius innovation, because it served as a substitute for warfare</p>

      <p id="a9UpcS">for a while, everyone played. men, women, old, young, whoever</p>

      <p id="reFRRW">they called it the “Little Brother of War.”</p>

      <p id="P7LN6a">absolutely brilliant. a big, sprawling game, far larger than any conventional sport that would follow. designed as a substitute for death.</p>

      <p id="wJFl0k">it’s inspired me beyond words</p>

      <p id="IwHzmj"></p>

      <p id="YieF7a">i mean</p>

      <p id="qeoihR"></p>

      <p id="l1NwiF"></p>

      <p id="OZxiK3"></p>

      <p id="CbcXHn"></p>

      <p id="9SWAaC"></p>
