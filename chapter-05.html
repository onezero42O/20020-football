      <p id="gD6OUt" class="monica">Yeah.</p>

      <p id="CheCoL" class="monica">No, still nothing. He keeps saying it was in a chest of some kind, like a treasure chest.</p>

      <p id="Lnn0Yw" class="monica">Well I don’t know what’s the difference between a regular chest and a treasure chest, besides the treasure.</p>

      <p id="EMTKA3" class="monica">Yeah ... I know.</p>

      <p id="KHWO33" class="monica"></p>

      <p id="xkcGDT" class="monica">I’m not sure. UCLA’s asking for an extension, though. They want us here three more days.</p>

      <p id="1NY7xn" class="monica">I don’t know. Of course, we can’t know for sure. He might be fucking with us, but he seems, like, obsessed with this. Like he just knows the ball is in there somewhere.</p>

      <p id="WfSr4u" class="monica"></p>

      <p id="nWLXxx" class="monica"></p>

      <p id="HgFz9N" class="monica"></p>

      <p id="c1kmT6" class="monica">Well listen, here’s what I think. I think he really does believe the ball is there. I also think … we’ve been here searching for a week and the search area is about 28 acres. That’s really not that big. There are 20 of us looking. We would have found it.</p>

        <p id="W5Ootb" class="chuck"><span class="name">Chuck: </span>Well, what you wanna do now is … how long you been playing?</p>

        <p id="fnwMPk" class="monica"><span class="name">Monica: </span>About 300 years.</p>

        <p id="QT9jHE" class="chuck"><span class="name">Chuck: </span>Well, some of you newer players haven’t necessarily seen something like this, but it’s happened a few times where some poor sucker just airmailed the ball onto a boat or something like that. And that boat just goes on down the lake, none the wiser!</p>

        <p id="6BPN96" class="monica"><span class="name">Monica: </span>Oh wow.</p>

        <p id="NH9YO3" class="chuck"><span class="name">Chuck: </span>Yeah, so you folks look and see. What you wanna do now is watch to see if there’s any blips on the scoreboard. If you see a team pop up and back down, you can bet your hat that’s what happened. Just a boat passing through their field.</p>

      <p id="gQltgn" class="chuck">Now if the score pops up and down real fast? That’s something faster, maybe a dump truck or something like that. There was actually a story once about a hawk come and picked up the ball, flew a hundred miles. Ha! I don’t think that’s true, though.</p>

      <p id="sQpEzA" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yeah that never happened</span></p>

      <p id="aMFxhV" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">This is fun! It’s fun to see when opposing players are pals.</span></p>

      <p id="UL0Krd" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">me too. it’s actually not too uncommon to see this. kinda depends on the program’s culture, really. some schools are hellbent on victory, some are a lot more chill</span></p>

      <p id="Uods0m" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Where do these teams fall on that spectrum?</span></p>

      <p id="pC7g99" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">well, Louisiana Tech and UCLA are both kinda bottom feeders these days. not a lot of depth, lots of newer players with less experience. i mean both programs take the game serious, but they’re still a few centuries away from relevance and they seem to know that</span></p>

      <p id="SmW7FE" class="juice"><span class="hl">but</span></p>

      <p id="CUBaF2" class="juice"><span class="hl">and fingers crossed here</span></p>

      <p id="mn9n9u" class="juice"><span class="hl">they may be about to deliver us something crazy</span></p>

      <p id="kMBsdD" class="juice"><span class="hl">see, Louisiana Tech and UCLA do not have an alliance with each other. that’s not what they’re doin here.</span></p>

      <p id="y26r9X" class="juice"><span class="hl">it’s 63 years ago. the year is 19957.</span></p>

      <p id="oQWG79" class="juice"><span class="hl">then, as now, UCLA had zero footballs. like a lot of other goose-egg teams without any particularly great ideas, they decided to send out five squads of 20 to kinda just roam around the country. they go on patrols, pick up whatever intelligence they can, and hope they get lucky</span></p>

      <p id="K13K3J" class="juice"><span class="hl">one of these squads is down in texas, marching up the Kansas field just outside of Tyler, Texas. one day they run into a Texas A&amp;M team with a football they’re tryin to bring home. this team has 28 players, outnumbering UCLA by a few, but hey it’s enough to play some football</span></p>

      <p id="32MIzm" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">this is known as the “castle keep” formation. it alludes to the inner keeps medieval lords would build inside their castles, naturally</span></p>

      <p id="y6KXSD" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Gimme a second with this. I haven’t had nearly as much time as you guys have to study up on the game. I mean I’m still trying to read up on the West Coast offense of the 1980s.</span></p>

      <p id="lPSSKz" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">lol you are younger than hell</span></p>

      <p id="fxI2OB" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">I’m older than both of you!</span></p>

      <p id="QZmmjr" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">lol you old as hell</span></p>

      <p id="yIqy36" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">It’s officially known as the “castle keep” offense, but I and a lot of others prefer to call it the “throw pillow” offense. It’s bloated and overcrowded.</span></p>

      <p id="KjPFbN" class="ten"><span class="hl">Imagine the triple option, except instead of a ball carrier, every option is an extra offense. Upon taking the snap, the quarterback can drop back and make her reads as usual, or she can pitch it back to her second or third quarterback.</span></p>

      <p id="zTgCXp" class="ten"><span class="hl">This offense briefly came into vogue around the 90th century. Problem is, it overcomplicates things for you a lot more than it does for your opponent. It’s for advanced offensive thinkers only. In lesser hands, it’s a mess.</span></p>

      <p id="IBR504" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yeahhh that was the case here</span></p>

      <p id="0Zvx1u" class="juice"><span class="hl">the thing about the modern college game is that it’s mostly made up of running around the country trying to get to the ball. you could very well go a long long long time without ever taking a snap. tough to retain play calling discipline. more often than not, it’s probably in your best interests to keep it simple</span></p>

      <p id="PYZiuV" class="juice"><span class="hl">but these are human beings, and human beings love playing with their toys</span></p>

      <p id="ipOtxu" class="juice"><span class="hl">it’s 1st and 10. the quarterback pitches it back to the second quarterback on the left side, who doesn’t catch it cleanly. he just chucks it out of bounds, damn near gets an intentional grounding penalty</span></p>

      <p id="MF3DcA" class="juice"><span class="hl">2nd and 10. this time they draw up nine verts: four wide receivers, the tight end, and both running backs from both auxiliary offenses. all streak downfield.</span></p>

      <p id="9sZLNm" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">but, as is common practice, UCLA has stationed three of its safeties way upfield to play prevent. with the help of that little line of trees, they successfully break it up. complete lack of imagination from A&amp;M here and they paid for it</span></p>

      <p id="LLwc93" class="juice"><span class="hl">all of a sudden it’s 3rd and 10. now, if you turn the ball over on downs, it’s not really the end of the world, right? UCLA would get the ball but you still outnumber them, you can most likely stop em and get it back</span></p>

      <p id="XMJRsb" class="juice"><span class="hl">but A&amp;M is trying to get the hell out of dodge. they’re tired and it’s getting late. they wanna make one huge gain that lets em streak miles downfield and get this overwith</span></p>

      <p id="fZUz0e" class="juice"><span class="hl">so they call nine verts AGAIN</span></p>

      <p id="gCzHSQ" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">This sucks!</span></p>

      <p id="wRm4I7" class="nine"><span class="hl">They need to ditch this offense. You outnumber them, you don’t need to try any misdirection or obscure your intent. Just beat ‘em up.</span></p>

      <p id="1xW6U4" class="juice"><span class="hl">and as one of the de facto leaders of this squad, it’s his turn to call his defense’s next play. he calls everyone’s favorite:</span></p>

      <p id="lCfUAP" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">lady you’re gonna love this. because this isn’t just a zero blitz, it’s a targeted zero blitz</span></p>

      <p id="RWK22T" class="juice"><span class="hl">Chuck is pushing all his chips in here. he believes that the third quarterback is gonna ask to make a throw, since he hasn’t yet. so UCLA decides they’re gonna bum-rush the west side of the field</span></p>

      <p id="BZ0v9O" class="juice"><span class="hl">his guess is absolutely right. UCLA’s line shifts west. their safeties creep up to the line just before the snap, then flood the west side of the field.

      <p id="IHAX82" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Seems like what offenses really need in this game is an offensive safety or two. A couple players positioned way backfield to prevent … what’s about to happen.</span></p>

      <p id="MDt5vo" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">There’s something I think about often, and it ties into something we talked about last time around.</span></p>

      <p id="PB1yHd" class="ten"><span class="hl">I think if you sat these people down in, I don’t know, 1990, and explained to them that they would live forever, they would imagine themselves in the distant future as supremely wise people. They’d tell you, “well, with all the time in the world, I’ll come to understand everything in the world. I won’t make mistakes anymore. I won’t fuck up anymore. I’ll become the best version of myself.”</span></p>

      <p id="kDkLz2" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">on paper, Chuck wasn’t the fastest guy on the field, but he hauled ass all the way to Oklahoma without getting caught. when it comes to long-distance football, whatever’s on paper often goes out the window. it comes down to who really wants it the most. who’s willing to run for 19 hours a day, and who prefers to call it in and ask for another squad on your team to run ‘em down.</span></p>

      <p id="vXux7y" class="juice"><span class="hl">nobody wanted it more than Chuck, turns out</span></p>

      <p id="trFKW9" class="juice"><span class="hl">now when you’re a lone ball carrier, the smart move is to change fields as few times as possible. you don’t wanna leave a trail on the scoreboard. if they see USC move up in the rankings, then they go down and Kansas State moves up, then they go down and Grambling moves up, everybody in the country can correctly guess that you’re moving a football in southeastern oklahoma, where those three fields run past each other</span></p>

      <p id="cW9aNI" class="juice"><span class="hl">if that happens, they find you and you’re fucked</span></p>

      <p id="wsXqhs" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">What happens if you have to line up at scrimmage and you’re the only player on your team?</span></p>

      <p id="nGG71J" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">something very stupid</span></p>

      <p id="uwpHkt" class="juice"><span class="hl">the old NCAA football rule book was our foundational text, and in almost every case we tried to interpret it as literally as possible. of course, there was neither a rule nor a mere insinuation for how a one-player offense should line up, so we just did our best</span></p>

      <p id="cLcmlu" class="juice"><span class="hl">the lonely player lines up at center and snaps the ball to nobody. in old football rules this would be treated like a fumble is treated. logically, it’s legal for the center to then turn around and recover it</span></p>

      <p id="0QeURx" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">But it would be just as legal for the defense to just bowl you over.</span></p>

      <p id="lo6RT4" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">yeah it’s a painful and humiliating experience.</span></p>

      <p id="hWOnFg" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">That’s cool.</span></p>

      <p id="5LSTIn" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">That sucks.</span></p>

      <p id="1SOYJi" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">that’s cool. motion passes 2-1</span></p>

      <p id="vkgWqE" class="juice"><span class="hl">so back to our buddy Chuck here. he’s made it about 200 miles north. he’s trying to stay on the Kansas field a while longer and then cut northwest. this is what players are coached to do when they’re carrying a ball by themselves. in the northwest united states it’s a lot more sparse and there’s a lot less action. less likely to run into trouble. from there he can just link up with the UCLA field, mission complete</span></p>

      <p id="beFXWn" class="juice"><span class="hl">but then at about the Kansas 398,800 yard line south, he runs into trouble. he’s hit to the Arkanas River, and on the other side he sees a huge squad of KU players who’ve finally showed up to figure out what a ball is doin on their field.</span></p>

      <p id="H9k99h" class="juice"><span class="hl">Chuck doesn’t really have a choice. he jukes northeast to transfer to Western Michigan’s field ...</span></p>

      <p id="aTt9dV" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">… then northwest to hop onto Louisiana Tech’s field.</span></p>

      <p id="QTlNP6" class="juice"><span class="hl">he knows that by doing this he’s gonna set off all kinds of alarm bells. again, people see Kansas pop on the scoreboard, then Western Michigan, then Louisiana Tech? everybody’s gonna know you got a ball and they’re gonna know right where you are</span></p>

      <p id="lftd7m" class="juice"><span class="hl">so Chuck’s on Louisiana Tech and he’s shit outta luck. he runs upfield and sees an army of Washington players combing through, looking for him under every log. he looks downfield. Kansas players doing the same. bad news all around</span></p>

      <p id="kgNya4" class="juice"><span class="hl">only hope now is to try and hide the football and come back for it later at some point</span></p>

      <p id="HO7hYq" class="juice"><span class="hl">now, two things to know about this if you didn’t bother to read the rule book i sent y’all. the first thing is that</span></p>

      <p id="te5IUD" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">I read it!</span></p>

      <p id="on0zXe" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">nerd</span></p>

      <p id="5aUUSR" class="juice"><span class="hl">the first thing is that you aren’t allowed to significantly alter on-field structures or terrain. so you can’t, for example, bury the ball. if we let people do that this game would never, ever end</span></p>

      <p id="MWSpde" class="juice"><span class="hl">the second thing is that every ball gives off a faint glow in the dark. this means you gotta be really, really skilled at hiding the ball. you gotta put a lot of thought into it</span></p>

      <p id="FvMgPA" class="juice"><span class="hl">or, in Chuck’s case, get almost impossibly lucky.</span></p>

      <p id="4yLCUU" class="juice"><span class="hl">he’s scurrying around in the hills outside of Lost City, desperately looking for somewhere to stash the ball, and eventually finds an old storage trunk.</span></p>

      <p id="wzmZD2" class="juice"><span class="hl">it’s old. thousands and thousands of years old. to this day i have no fuckin idea how it got there or what it’s doing in the middle of nowhere. neither does Chuck, but he doesn’t care</span></p>

      <p id="oHaTPD" class="juice"><span class="hl">it’s sunken into the ground, sticking out just enough for Chuck to pry the lid open and drop the ball in. now this is when he should look around for landmarks and try to figure out exactly where he’s at. but he’s panicked, and exhausted, and seriously sleep-deprived, and it’s the middle of the night. he glances around, feels like he has a good enough idea of his location, and walks out of the hills</span></p>

      <p id="OHefYE" class="juice"><span class="hl">when Kansas players intercept him, they find him without a football. he gives em a friendly wave and goes on his way</span></p>

      <p id="RQuVq3" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">But like you said, everyone in the country can deduce that it’s up there in the hills somewhere.</span></p>

      <p id="Qm16xm" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">well, Washington spent all night in the hills. 40 or so players, combing every stretch, looking for something that glowed in the dark. couldn’t find the fuckin thing. after three nights of searching, they gave up</span></p>

      <p id="1Bgwjz" class="juice"><span class="hl">but meanwhile, the rest of the country just assumed Washington recovered it</span></p>

      <p id="xpIcVk" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Yeah, but the scoreboard showed that Louisiana Tech had a ball on their field. It still says that now. Why would people assume that?</span></p>

      <p id="SO59cQ" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">well, they assumed that Washington took the ball and hid it somewhere else on Tech’s field. took it and hid it somewhere way up north, probably, although from their perspective, there’s no telling</span></p>

      <p id="hR28Rd" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">You can do that?</span></p>

      <p id="C5JYdi" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">sure, why not? teams have sometimes done that, it’s a known tactic</span></p>

      <p id="3KbGVr" class="nine"><span class="hl name">Nine: </span><span class="hl">Why would you hide your ball on someone else’s field if you had a choice?</span></p>

      <p id="Tw6Vwm" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">hey, maybe you’ve found a real, real good hiding spot. or maybe you just wanna drive your opponent nuts. remember, all that matters is that you have all the balls on your own field at the end of the game. until then you can dump em wherever you think is safe</span></p>

      <p id="7avr1J" class="juice"><span class="hl">to Louisiana Tech and everyone else, that seemed like a far more reasonable explanation than “40 people spent three nights looking for a glow-in-the-dark football that was hidden by one dude who didn’t even know the terrain and they couldn’t find it”</span></p>

      <p id="BSAM53" class="juice"><span class="hl">and indeed, for the last 63 years, Louisiana Tech has had a ball on their field, they can’t find it, and it drives them fuckin CRAZY</span></p>

      <p id="5g6cNF" class="juice"><span class="hl">Chuck has wanted to sneak back in and find it, but the area’s just so hot with activity these days that he couldn’t go anywhere near these hills without drawing suspicion from Tech</span></p>

      <p id="mIQFMe" class="juice"><span class="hl">but UCLA really wants to bring this ball home. so they struck a deal.</span></p>

      <p id="TW7MIv" class="juice"><span class="hl">you can sort of think of this as an archeological mission. UCLA called up Louisiana Tech and was like, hey. we know exactly where it is. if you let Chuck here onto your field for a few days to go get it, we’ll challenge you to a conventional football game on your home field. old-school, 100-yard football, with 100 players on each team.</span></p>

      <p id="mjPrys" class="juice"><span class="hl">winner takes the ball.</span></p>

      <p id="jnVnai" class="ten"><span class="hl name">Ten: </span><span class="hl">Holy shit. This I want to see.</span></p>

      <p id="kbnPhc" class="juice"><span class="hl name">Juice: </span><span class="hl">me too!</span></p>

      <p id="7QqyOT" class="juice"><span class="hl">except he CAN’T FUCKIN FIND IT!</span></p>
